The here@@ by presented Special Condition has been classified as important and as such shall be subject to public consultation , in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) of which states :
2.@@ 1.5 Instrument and other systems essential for the safety of flight must be provided with ice protection for the full icing envelope as defined in C@@ S@@ 29 Appendix C or the AC@@ 29.@@ 14@@ 19 Al@@ titu@@ de-@@ Limited envelope .
this would typically be a requirement for a de-icing layer at least 500@@ ft above the surface or safety level , to which the aircraft can descend safely following crew recognition of a dec@@ la@@ red limitation having been reached .
any limited icing clearance must include a means of v@@ ac@@ ating icing conditions from any point within the dec@@ la@@ red envelope and demon@@ stration of the subsequent natural de-icing characteristics of the rotor systems and airframe .
such a clearance is only en@@ vi@@ s@@ aged for a Large Ro@@ tor@@ craft certificated in accordance with CS 29 , or equivalent , including Category A and IFR approval and operated in accordance with E@@ U-@@ OPS or equivalent operating standards .
this capability can be utili@@ sed in specific operational situations that allow the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter to change flight conditions in order to avoid or v@@ ac@@ ate atmospheric conditions beyond the demonstrated icing capability .
this section must address any emergency procedures specific to the operation of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft in icing conditions and any modification of existing emergency procedures due to the operation in icing conditions .
the Flight Manual Supp@@ lement must include a sta@@ tement that the limited icing clearance assu@@ mes an ability to v@@ ac@@ ate the icing environment at any time from within the dec@@ la@@ red envelope and to de-@@ ice natu@@ rally .
any in-flight icing detection system display ( s ) , status lights , and / or crew alerting messages must be located so that they are within the seated flight crew forward vision scan area while performing their normal duties .
there should be a means identified or provided for determining the formation of ice on critical parts of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft which can be met by a reliable and safe natural warning or an ice detection system .
the effect of acc@@ re@@ tion of ice on the handling , stability , performance and vibration characteristics of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft must be established by flight in natural icing conditions and other means of compliance as required .
during this first climb segment , in compliance with CS 29.@@ 67 ( a ) ( 1 ) , a minimum of 100 fpm rate of climb ( Ro@@ C ) with the One -@@ Engine Inoperative ( O@@ E@@ I ) power , the landing gear down and V@@ TO@@ SS is to be guaran@@ te@@ ed .
the following Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding ( ES@@ F ) has been classified as important and as such shall be subject to public consultation in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board Decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) which states :
the following Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding has been classified as important and as such shall be subject to public consultation in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) which states :
the here@@ by-@@ presented Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding has been classified as an important Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding and as such has been subject to public consultation , in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) of which states :
the following Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding ( ES@@ F ) has been classified as important and as such was subject to public consultation in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) which states :
EMI installation testing consists of interro@@ g@@ ating the control , if it has such a feature , to determine if the critical electronic control system is adversely affected ( identify the recorded faults that occur during the test ) .
the here@@ by presented Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding has been classified as an important Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding and as such shall be subject to public consultation , in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) , which states :
? are there specific requirements defined with reg@@ ards to the desired output of this post-@@ processing step ( s ) ( e.g. , final micro@@ structure at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes , acceptable levels of an@@ iso@@ tro@@ py , remaining level of residual stress etc . ) ?
Ro@@ tor@@ craft typically have not had electronic controls that perform critical functions , such as engine controls and flight controls , therefore there was no real concern about requiring equipment to be qualified to aircraft standards .
un@@ qualified equipment and their effects on critical systems is of particular concern due to the recent increase in the number of Ro@@ tor@@ craft with electronic engine controls and the imple@@ mentation of fly-by-wire technology .
in order to use this method of demon@@ stra@@ ting compliance , the compara@@ tive analysis must show that the applicant material is identical to the original design approval holder tested material , and that the testing requirements are the same for both applications of the material .
for ibf installations in Ro@@ tor@@ craft not approved for flight in icing conditions , a demon@@ stration of 30-@@ minute hold capability in the continuous maximum cloud would be acceptable in accordance with the AC 27@@ -1 or AC 29@@ -2 guidance .
this limitation prevents ca@@ sca@@ ding trac@@ eability issues and enables the FAA to identify the source of any non-@@ compliance or lack of compliance data so that we may initiate appropriate corrective action .
including restricted category with standard category Ro@@ tor@@ craft on the same AM@@ L ST@@ C will require that the restricted category Ro@@ tor@@ craft meet the same requirements as the standard category Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
if significant changes in structural stiffness and / or geometry result from the failed repair , analysis for flutter and other aero@@ elastic in@@ sta@@ b@@ il@@ ities must be performed to ensure the failed repair does not lead to other flight safety issues .
to ensure the safe emp@@ loy@@ ment of composites in manufacture and repair of aircraft products , these products need to be in compliance with the airworthiness standards set forth in 14 C@@ FR , which include :
during this second climb segment , in compliance with CS 29.@@ 67 ( a ) ( 2 ) , at least 150 fpm Ro@@ C must be guaran@@ te@@ ed at Maximum Continuous Power O@@ E@@ I ( M@@ CP O@@ E@@ I ) , with the landing gear up at@@ the speed selected by the applicant .
given the comple@@ xity of inlet distortion limits , the specialized instru@@ mentation , and the required analysis of data , sta@@ te@@ ments about accep@@ tability of inlet distortion without supporting data are unacceptable .
after the worst case interference is defined , the interference must be eliminated at the source or the interference must be evaluated to assure that the critical electronic controls , its functions , and its related indications do not result in an unsafe condition .
during ground and flight tests , the applicant should include a human factors Assessment of crew alerting systems , alternate air source integration and operation , and crew procedures and limitations prescribed by the R@@ FMS .
App@@ lic@@ ants should exp@@ ec@@ t that the certific@@ ating off@@ ici@@ als would consider this information when making findings of compliance relevant to new certificate actions or actions relating to maintenance , preventive maintenance , or al@@ te@@ rations .
2.@@ 3.@@ 1.1 Wh@@ ere all control channels are operating in parallel and their output signals are con@@ sol@@ id@@ ated , the affected control channel should be deactivated or isolated while the remaining channels provide the required functionality .
the location of a control can significantly affect the pilot ability to identify the control easily , the ease and convenience of operation of the control , confusion as to the control operation , and an inadvertent operation of that control .
as a result , the level and characteristics of pilots inte@@ rac@@ tions with cockpit and avionics systems is changing , particularly for Ro@@ tor@@ craft that are not capable of operating under instrument flight rules ( IFR ) .
2 . Deviations from the applicable airworthiness codes , environmental protection certification specifications and / or acceptable means of compliance with Part 21 , as well as important special conditions and equivalent safety findings , shall be submitted to the panel of ex@@ per@@ ts and be subject to a public consultation of at least 3 weeks , except if they have been previously agreed and published in the Off@@ ic@@ ial Publication of the A@@ gency .
the final decision shall be published in the Off@@ ic@@ ial Publication of the A@@ gency .
FAA AC-@@ 29.@@ 14@@ 19 recogn@@ is@@ es that the full icing envelope of Appendix C includes an altitude range up to 30@@ ,000 ft . , which is beyond the normal operating envelope of a h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , and permits the use of an altitude restricted envelope to a maximum of 10@@ ,000 ft .
it is important to conduct evalu@@ ations using in@@ divi@@ du@@ als representing a range of potential user physical dimensions and users wearing different app@@ are@@ l , such as long slee@@ ved sh@@ ir@@ ts , jac@@ kets , and gloves .
to achieve full certification for flight of a Ro@@ tor@@ craft in icing conditions , an applicant must demon@@ st@@ rate in accordance with CS 29.@@ 14@@ 19 that the Ro@@ tor@@ craft can be safely operated in the range of continuous and intermittent icing conditions defined in CS 29 , Appendix C .
additionally , integrating new tech@@ no@@ log@@ ies , such as a sa@@ tel@@ li@@ te-@@ based augmentation system ( SB@@ AS ) or wide area augmentation system ( W@@ A@@ AS ) increases the Ro@@ tor@@ craft avionics system capabilities to perform functions and operations it was not previously capable of performing .
the purpose of this miscellaneous guidance section is to provide applic@@ ants with general guidelines on how to approach compliance with 14 C@@ FR part 29 sections that have provi@@ sion relating to human factors ( HF ) or human performance .
con@@ currently to full@@ -icing approval App@@ lic@@ ants are also se@@ e@@ king approval for limited icing clearance , explo@@ iting the capability that an un@@ protected h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter ( cold bla@@ ded ) may have to operate safely and successfully within a limited set of atmospheric conditions , provided that suitable airworthiness and operational constraints are applied .
this part of the regulation per@@ tains to proper lab@@ eling of cockpit equipment for identification , functionality , and operating limitations , usually accomplished by placing a tag or label on the outside of the equipment .
additionally , Appendix D to part 25 contains information regarding criteria for minimum crew determination for airplanes operating under IFR conditions , which may be benef@@ ic@@ ial for de@@ termin@@ ations in Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
the clearance must be defined in terms of parameters readily available to , and observ@@ able by , the operating crew and must also allow a safe exit to conditions in which the Ro@@ tor@@ craft will de-@@ ice natu@@ rally should this pro@@ ve necessary .
( 3 ) As a normal part of the certification pro@@ ject , the applicant and the FAA / AUTH@@ ORITY usually establish an early and formal wr@@ itten certification plan on the certification basis , the methods of compliance , and the sche@@ du@@ les for completing the certification pro@@ ject .
the FAA will recognize limited use of the compara@@ tive analysis / trac@@ eability method for fl@@ am@@ ma@@ bility compliance , if a review sho@@ wed the risk of a non-@@ compliance using this method is low , and we have no evidence this past practice created any unsafe condition .
2.@@ 1.3 The in@@ takes must , further , have been shown to be fully compli@@ ant with the snow protection requirements of C@@ S@@ 29.@@ 10@@ 93 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( II ) or only for level flight and descent phases of flight , but in that case the flight manual shall prohib@@ its flight in snow .
the parameters by which the approval will be restricted may include Altitude , OAT , Aircraft mass , ice se@@ ver@@ ity ( Liquid Water Content ) , Airspeed , Power required , duration , Man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ res limitations and / or ice acc@@ re@@ tion limits on un@@ protected areas of the airframe .
exposure to more severe conditions for a limited time period must also be substanti@@ ated to allow sufficient safety margins to exit the icing environment or to ca@@ ter for transient increase in se@@ ver@@ ity during a period of continuous exposure .
De@@ mon@@ stra@@ tions and tests intended to show compliance should use production quality hardware and be conducted in a vari@@ ety of lighting conditions ( for example , dark , bright forward field , sh@@ af@@ ting sunlight ) .
due to the effect other Ro@@ tor@@ craft electrical systems have on individual systems , compliance tests should be conducted in the Ro@@ tor@@ craft , although there may be sub@@ m@@ it@@ tal of supporting data from laboratory testing to supplement Ro@@ tor@@ craft testing .
while some of this equipment is qualified to aircraft standards , particularly environmental standards , some of the equipment not qualified to such standards may be the source of harmful electromagnetic interference .
any increase in loads and stresses in critical parts due to ice acc@@ re@@ tion must not adversely affect the capability of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft to meet the structural requirements of CS 29 when the Ro@@ tor@@ craft is operated within the established flight limitations associated to limited icing operations .
I ) The static strength evaluation required by 29.@@ 305 , by considering a con@@ serv@@ ative estimate of the amount of ice forming during fight and including the effects of any single failure of the ice detection system to del@@ i@@ ver its intended function .
to address the interference aspec@@ ts of equipment known to have a high potential for interference , the equipment must be tested as a part of the installation as described in paragraphs 7 and 8 , during ground and flight tests .
( II ) The use of the display does not require un@@ reasonable training requirements to demon@@ st@@ rate adequately that the pilot can understand and properly operate the system in all operational environments .
it is important that the selected colors maintain integrity ( for example , red looks red , amber looks amber ) and discrimin@@ ability ( that is , colors can be distinguished reliably from each other ) from all potential viewing angles and under all expected lighting levels .
for example , describing a function or component , such as a display , as for pilot situation awareness only or , for situ@@ ational awareness only is not adequate regardless of whether the function or component is required by the regulations .
( 2 ) Spo@@ ken ( voice ) alerts can have advan@@ tages over other forms of audio warnings since they conve@@ y specific information without the pilot having to interpre@@ t a tone or rever@@ t to a visual display to determine the ex@@ act failure .
a better example for a non-@@ required function might be to increase terrain awareness . identify the following items , as appropriate , focusing on new or unique features that affect the crew interface or the allo@@ ca@@ tion of tasks between the pilot ( s ) and the Ro@@ tor@@ craft systems :
( II ) Audio levels should be easily set and controlled in the event one alert is over@@ ly lou@@ d and dist@@ rac@@ ting ( for example , an audio alert is di@@ ver@@ ted from a cockpit speaker to headsets , adjustment of the alert volume may be necessary to compensate for the lower ambient noise of a headset v@@ s. the ambient noise in a cockpit .
App@@ lic@@ ants may choose to use methods similar to those emp@@ loy@@ ed for § 29.@@ 7@@ 77 to demon@@ st@@ rate the ability of the pilot to identify and reach a specific circuit breaker or fuse when essential to safety in flight .
a dec@@ la@@ ration is required that the Supp@@ lement does not con@@ stitute an operational approval and that operations must be conducted in accordance with the relevant operating regulations ADDRES@@ SING flight in icing conditions , such as E@@ U-@@ OPS .
for example , whether field loadable software , maintenance , and configuration functions are accessible by the pilot in flight and on the ground , or whether they are accessible only by maintenance personnel .
App@@ lic@@ ants should describe how to evaluate the ability of the pilot to identify the device readily and whether it is installed on a circuit breaker panel or controlled using an electronic device ( such as a screen that can display the circuit breaker status and is controllable ) .
additive Manufac@@ turing : describes the process of jo@@ ining materials to make objects from three dimensional ( 3D ) model data using layer upon layer technique / method , as op@@ posed to sub@@ trac@@ tive manufacturing meth@@ o@@ do@@ log@@ ies .
the primary purpose of cockpit lighting is to allow the crew to quickly see , accurately locate , identify , and , if appropriate , inte@@ rac@@ t with displays or controls under both low and high ambient lighting conditions .
the failure to v@@ ac@@ ate the icing environment if environment or aircraft limits are reached shall be classified according to CS 29.@@ 1309 and all systems and equipment involved in that failure condition shall be demonstrated to comply with CS 29.@@ 1309
the here@@ by presented Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding has been classified as an important Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding and as such shall be subject to public consultation , in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) of which states :
Wh@@ il@@ st it is the objective of this special condition to allow limited approval of Ro@@ tor@@ craft not equipped with full ice protection systems , any system or item of equipment essential for the safety of flight must be fully protected against the effects of ice and low temperatures e.g. pitot &amp; static systems , Wind@@ screens , engine in@@ takes .
including measurements and dimensions of displays , their locations and locations of controls relative to the pilot central line of vision or the design eye position is also benef@@ ic@@ ial to both the applicant and certification authority te@@ ams .
the Boeing 737@@ -8@@ 200 / -@@ 9 / -@@ 900@@ ER models are each configured with the same baseline emergency exit arrangement , which consists of two pairs of oversized Type C exits ( same rating th@@ ank Type I ) and two pairs of overwing Type III exits .
for airplane configurations that do not require a full Type II exit rating , there would be significant advan@@ tages if these exits could be classified as Type III exits due to their reduced PASS@@ AG@@ EW@@ AY width requirements and no requirement for assist spaces at the exits .
therefore , Boeing requests that the additional pair of de-@@ rated Type II ( Type III ) exits allow the 737@@ -8@@ 200 / -@@ 9 / -@@ 900@@ ER airplanes to be configured with up to 210 passenger seats based on the compensating features as outlined below .
the design of the 737@@ -8@@ 200 , 737@@ -@@ 9 , and 737@@ -@@ 900@@ ER aero@@ planes with exit arrang@@ e@@ ments including a pair of MED emergency exits as de-@@ rated Type II ( Type III ) does not comply with the following requirements unless an Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding is g@@ ran@@ ted by EAS@@ A :
I ) The static strength evaluation required by 29.@@ 305 , by considering a con@@ serv@@ ative estimate of the amount of ice forming during fight and including the effects of any single failure of the ice detection system to del@@ i@@ ver its intended function .
the here@@ by presented Special Conditions have been classified as important and as such shall be subject to public consultation , in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) of which states :
the here@@ by presented Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding ( ES@@ F ) has been classified as an important Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding and as such shall be subject to public consultation , in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) of which states :
although sometimes considered less complex than installations for operation under IFR , the HF evaluation of installations for operation under VFR should include the same rig@@ or , as both present HF ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es to the pilot .
for example , complex systems or systems that require the pilot to sp@@ end considera@@ ble time inter@@ facing with a system functions and inte@@ rac@@ tions with other Ro@@ tor@@ craft systems will require the pilot to allo@@ c@@ ate attention from flying the Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
for example , for installation of a new ED@@ S su@@ ite and a W@@ A@@ AS GPS system that interfaces with the existing autopilot and one of the new operations is ste@@ ep angle low speed approaches , consider how the system will support or change pilot workload .
an increase in the passenger seating configuration above the maximum permitted under sub-@@ paragraph ( c ) ( 1 ) of this paragraph but not to exceed a total of 299 seats may be allowed in accordance with the following table for each additional pair of emergency exits ...
however , since the airplane is already configured with two pairs of Type III exits over the wing ( 65 passenger limitation ) , class@@ ifying the M@@ id@@ - Cabin exits as Type III exits is effectively precluded due to the 70 passenger seat limitation for all Type III exits in CS 25.@@ 807 ( g ) ( 7 ) .
( 3 ) For each Type C , I or II exit installed in an aero@@ plane with seating for more than 80 passengers , an assist space must be provided at one side of the PASS@@ AG@@ EW@@ AY regardless of whether an assisting means is required by CS 25.@@ 810 ( a ) .
the already very good evacuation capability of the Boeing 737@@ -8@@ 200 , 737@@ -@@ 9 , and 737@@ -@@ 900@@ ER aero@@ planes is further improved by adding the pair of proposed de-@@ rated Type II ( Type III ) exits in the middle of the largest passenger cabin zone .
( a ) The process and level of evaluation for determining minimum crew for these situations will depend on the differences between already certificated models and configurations , and the model or configuration se@@ e@@ king certification .
the parts of the certification plan that address the HF portions of the regulations should describe the methods used to demon@@ st@@ rate compliance with sufficient detail to allow the certification authority to evaluate the appro@@ pri@@ a@@ ten@@ ess and adequ@@ ac@@ y of the proposed methods of compliance .
for Ro@@ tor@@ craft with an established minimum crew , the purpose of this testing will be to corro@@ borate by demon@@ stration the predicted crew workload submitted by applic@@ ants in order to substanti@@ ate compliance with § 29.@@ 15@@ 23 .
the powder shape and sta@@ tis@@ tical distribution of particle sizes in the powder bed affect whether the powder can consistently be spread uniformly along the powder bed , with the proper density , to support a quality fusion process .
( B ) supplemental type certificate or am@@ ended type certificate modifications to avionics systems can significantly Al@@ ter pilot workload , particularly if the modification ad@@ ds new digital or electronic display and flight guidance technology into an ol@@ der , mo@@ st@@ ly ro@@ und@@ -@@ dial or analog cockpit .
as a result , this combination of a relatively large and accessible exit with a flight attendant sta@@ tioned nearby will provide evacuation capability that is more than co@@ m@@ men@@ su@@ rate with the relatively small increase in passenger limit ( 35 passengers or less ) .
1 ) The de-@@ rated Type II ( Type III ) exits are flo@@ or@@ -@@ level exits measuring over 50 inch high by 25 inch wide , having typical pass@@ age@@ ways associated with Type III exits , and having a flight attendant sta@@ tioned near the exit pair .
the design and performance of the de-@@ rated Type II ( Type III ) exits will be shown to j@@ us@@ tify the E@@ limin@@ ation of the assist space and the use of the reduced pass@@ age@@ ways that are consistent with that normally allowed for a pair of Type III exits with a 35 passenger rating .
this will be demonstrated with syste@@ m@@ -@@ level evacuation testing .
( II ) D@@ ue to the sub@@ jec@@ tive n@@ ature of many of the HF aspec@@ ts of the regulations , the certification authorities en@@ cou@@ rage applic@@ ants to carefully consider and thoroughly describe the means they inten@@ d to use to demon@@ st@@ rate compliance with each regulation .
En@@ ab@@ ling the new capabilities by re@@ lying on the pilot to compensate for the inadequate performance of the integration is not recommended and may raise issues regarding the original minimum crew determination .
the operator and all par@@ ties supporting the operator should have remote , multi@@ - user and timely access to the data and the Diag@@ no@@ stic processes in order to assist in determining the continued airworthiness of their fleet .
2 ) although the MED exits are designed to be operated by passengers , a flight attendant will be sta@@ tioned near them and will be able to focus on man@@ aging the evacuation of passengers throughout the mid@@ -@@ cabin area .
this mid@@ -@@ cabin guidance will help ensure good utilization of all exits , especially in the event one or more of the exits is unusable .
the presence of a cabin crew member at the MED exits will result in an app@@ rec@@ i@@ able increase in the level of safety for the proposed emergency exits arrangement .
in fact , the presence of the cabin crew member will reduce the risk that :
the MED cabin attendant seat part number and installation location will be identical to the cabin attendant seat that is currently certified on the 737@@ -@@ 900@@ ER and 737@@ -@@ 9 airplanes when the MED is rated as a Type II exit .
the fusion process parameters specified to control the P@@ B@@ F machine are set to achieve the desired material density , geometric detail , micro@@ structure , surface texture , and other f@@ us@@ i@@ on-@@ related characteristics of the as@@ -@@ built structure .
this report , Assessment of Crew workload Measurement Methods , Tech@@ ni@@ ques , and Procedures , Volume II ( Report No . WR@@ DC@@ -@@ TR@@ -@@ 89@@ -@@ 700@@ 6 ) , provides guidance for selecting and using a number of sub@@ jec@@ tive , ph@@ y@@ si@@ ological , and performance based workload measurement techniques .
therefore , at the initiation of evacuation , depending on the circumstances , the cabin crew member sta@@ tioned at the MED may choose to open the adjacent exit or move to a position near the main aisle where they can effectively provide instructions to passengers at the MED exits on both sides of the airplane .
EAS@@ A con@@ si@@ ders that the proposed design does not directly comply with CS 29.@@ 78@@ 3 ( e ) and compensating factors to support an Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding for this Certification Specification need to be demonstrated along the following principles :
3 ) The PASS@@ AG@@ EW@@ AY ( s ) leading to the de-@@ rated Type II ( Type III ) MED exits will comply with the requirements in CS 25.@@ 813 ( c ) , A@@ men@@ d@@ ment 17 and the related AM@@ C 25.@@ 813 ( c ) .
AM@@ C 25.@@ 813 ( c ) item 1 allows up to 3 inches of seat permanent deformation into the minimum PASS@@ AG@@ EW@@ AY dimension .
elements of the P@@ B@@ F process , including the process parameters , that can influence the out@@ come of the P@@ B@@ F process ( e.g. , mechanical , tensile , metall@@ ur@@ g@@ ical , or chemical properties ) are identified as significant process elements and are frozen and require re@@ qu@@ al@@ ification if changed .
when evalu@@ ating for exce@@ p@@ tional pilot skill , evalu@@ ators should consider the comple@@ xity of the task in terms of the performance requirement ( level of accuracy or precision ) , the number of steps , memory load , checklist use , ti@@ me@@ -to-@@ perform , and if needed , training requirements .
a ) When two 6-@@ inch pass@@ age@@ ways leading to the de-@@ rated Type II ( Type III ) exit are provided , the forward edge of the forward PASS@@ AG@@ EW@@ AY and the aft edge of the aft PASS@@ AG@@ EW@@ AY will be located such that the exit opening will be totally within the fore and aft bo@@ unds of the unobstructed space adjacent to the exit .
the triple seats bo@@ unding the forward and aft end of the unobstructed space adjacent to the exit shall not en@@ cro@@ ach into the exit clear opening .
the automa@@ tion features should follow a design ph@@ i@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y that supports the intended functions regarding the system be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or ; modes of operation ; and pilot interface with controls , displays , and alerts .
it is important that the proposed methods of HF compliance are coordinated and discussed with the certification authority to identify HF issues early in the program to avoid certification schedule de@@ la@@ ys .
B ) For two 6-@@ inch PASS@@ AG@@ EW@@ AY configurations , where the aft triple seat may be installed just aft of the MED opening , 3-@@ inches of deformation should be allowed into the MED pro@@ jected opening provided the exit operating characteristics are not comp@@ ro@@ mi@@ sed .
this partial obstruction of the exit opening allowance is similar to that provided in AM@@ C 25.@@ 813 , item 5 related to de-@@ rated and oversized exits .
in addition , as this will be a de-@@ rated Type II door functioning as a Type III exit which will include door operational in@@ struc@@ tional placards , de@@ forma@@ tions that may partially ob@@ sc@@ u@@ res the door handle directional symbol is acceptable .
( F ) An evaluation team is usually assembled when certificated systems and the proposed system are significantly different .
such a team includes applicant test pilots , certification authority test pilots , and , if the certification team dee@@ ms it advi@@ sable , line pilots who rout@@ in@@ ely fly similar Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
the testing should be conducted using sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os represen@@ tative of the type of operations used for the Ro@@ tor@@ craft . testing should include various types of routes , n@@ av@@ ig@@ ational aids , environmental conditions and traffic den@@ si@@ ties . 
give particular attention to tasks that invol@@ ve planning and execution of emergency and non-normal procedures .
when appropriate , also consider dispatch under the Master Minimum Equipment List in combination with other failures that are likely to result in significantly increased pilot and crew workload .
since display format and media also influence workload , the number , size , location , type of display , and presen@@ tation format should also be part of the overall evaluation .
one is whether the un@@ mista@@ k@@ able warning to the pilot  is , in fact , un@@ mista@@ k@@ able .
another is the use of un@@ approved devices to lock the control system . 
various approaches and devices developed to make it apparent that the control is locked .
when evalu@@ ating a control lock system , consider several factors in finding compliance with the regulation .
C ) When one 13-@@ inch PASS@@ AG@@ EW@@ AY leading to the de-@@ rated Type II ( Type III ) exit is provided , CS 25.@@ 813 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( i ) do@@ es@@ n &@@ a@@ po@@ s@@ ;@@ t directly apply , since the outboard seat adjacent to the exit will always be removed .
however , the intent of CS 25.@@ 813 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( i ) will be applied , since at least 10 inches of the 13-@@ inch PASS@@ AG@@ EW@@ AY will be in the pro@@ jected clear opening of the exit . 
as a result , the for@@ war@@ d-@@ most point of the double seat adjacent to the exit will always be less than 3 inches forward of the exit centerline , which will ensure at least 10 inches of the PASS@@ AG@@ EW@@ AY is within the pro@@ jected opening of the exit . 
in addition to having the PASS@@ AG@@ EW@@ AY in accordance with CS 25.@@ 813 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( i ) , and the outboard seat adjacent to the exit will always be removed when the exit is rated as a de-@@ rated Type II ( Type III ) exit .
if icons are used , there should be no reduction in the level of pilot performance when compared with performance obtained using text lab@@ eling , and can be measured using time to interpre@@ t and accuracy of interpre@@ tation of that control function .
to avoid confusion with having two different exit ratings between the FAA and EAS@@ A for otherwise identical exits , it is proposed that EAS@@ A allow Boeing documentation to refer to these de-@@ rated Type II exits as Type III exits when meeting all the compensating features / factors outlined herein .
pilots should be capable of performing CONTROL@@ - related tasks to the same performance standards that would result from the use of conventional controls , unless the dec@@ rement is in@@ con@@ sequential and the design enables other significant performance gains or design simp@@ lif@@ ications .
( I ) Drawings of the cockpit layout showing positions of system components , even if preliminary , are benef@@ ic@@ ial for providing an understanding of the intended overall cockpit arrangement ( controls , displays , sample display screens , seating , stowage , and so forth ) .
this regulation cor@@ relates with most of the other HF@@ - related regulations , particularly in situations where a pilot may allo@@ c@@ ate attention to a particular system or task at the expen@@ se of flying the Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
this feature , comple@@ mented with the shift of the door 3 four frames aft , compared to the A@@ 3@@ 21-@@ 27@@ x@@ N / -@@ 25@@ x@@ N models , is ai@@ med at supporting the increase of the Maximum Passenger Se@@ ating Capacity ( MP@@ S@@ C ) from the currently certified value of 220 .
process valid@@ ation requirements may include , but are not limited to part cut@@ ups , metall@@ ur@@ g@@ ical exam@@ in@@ ations , manufacturing sequence sheets , first ar@@ ticle inspections , chemistry , dimensional , and mechanical properties .
except as further restricted in sub@@ paragraphs ( g ) ( 1 ) through ( g ) ( 9 ) of this paragraph , the maximum number of passenger seats permitted for each exit of a specific type installed on each side of the fuselage is as follows :
by this approach it will be demonstrated that the performance will be reached or exceeded to allow the desired increase in maximum number of passenger seats permitted for the single and the dual O@@ W@@ E configuration .
in case of failure conditions that affect the indication of the current airspeed and the relevant V@@ N@@ E , there is no change in the mi@@ tig@@ ating measures and / or the emergency procedures that allow restoration of the airspeed and V@@ N@@ E indication .
cockpit controls must be - ( b ) Loca@@ ted and arranged with respect to the pilots seats so that there is full and un@@ restricted movement of each control without interference from the cockpit structure or the pilot clothing when pilots from 5 fn to 6 fn in height are seated .
the applicant should demon@@ st@@ rate through testing , with sta@@ tis@@ tically significant results , that the O@@ W@@ E exit configuration provides a pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate increase in evacuation performance over the standard Type III defined by the following requirements at A@@ m@@ d@@ t 15 :
it is expected that parts manufactured using P@@ B@@ F will require thermal processing operations to e@@ vol@@ ve the as@@ -@@ built micro@@ structure into a final form providing proper and predic@@ table material performance .
the applicant should demon@@ st@@ rate through an acceptable number of partial evacuation tests or a full scale evacuation demon@@ stration , under the conditions set in CS 25 Appendix J , that the new configuration will increase the evacuation performance of the Type III emergency exits to an extent that the evacuation performance at aircraft level , considering the new desired MP@@ S@@ C , will meet the requirements of C@@ S@@ 25.@@ 803 ( c ) including the safety margins described in the associated guidance material .
any increase of the dimensions of the emergency exit access area ( i.e. PASS@@ AG@@ EW@@ AY , access space , main aisle , etc . ) above the minimum values required by the regulations to demon@@ st@@ rate the desired evacuation performance will con@@ stitute a limitation of the design of the new over-@@ performing Type III emergency exit .
for the single O@@ W@@ E configuration , should the tests demon@@ st@@ rate an evacuation performance which would lead to a passenger cre@@ di@@ t above 40 , the cre@@ di@@ t of the new over-@@ performing Type III emergency exit will be in any case limited to 40 .

the following Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding ( ES@@ F ) has been classified as important and as such shall be subject to public consultation in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) which states :
as an example with car 7 - PART 7 Ro@@ tor@@ craft airworthiness ; TRANSPOR@@ T categories . car 7.@@ 737 ( b ) ( 4 ) CONTROL MARKINGS -@@ Pow@@ er-@@ plant fuel controls sub@@ paragraph ( 4 ) as am@@ ended to Au@@ gust 1 , 19@@ 56 issue , the rule states :

with respect to materials , components and equipment , means the capability to withstand the application of heat by a flame , for a period of 15 minutes without any failure that would create a hazard to the aircraft .
inspections of parts provide re@@ occurring evidence of build quality , but a standardi@@ zed reference part may be optimized to more readily provide qual@@ i@@ ti@@ tative and quantitative evidence of the quality of the geometric ren@@ dering of the process .
a reference part , if used , would be designed with purpose built features that serve as me@@ tr@@ ics of build quality , dimensional accuracy , and process stability and would be produced in the fur@@ the@@ st locations on the build plate .
the means of Compliance with CS 29.@@ 11@@ 93 ( e ) ( 3 ) have been selected with reference to the AC 20-@@ 135 , agree@@ ing on fire testing pass / fail criteria that should result in with@@ standing a flame , as specified above in C@@ S-@@ Definitions for  fireproof demon@@ stration , without any burn through the test specimen during 15 minutes in the following conditions on ground and in flight :
CS identify some specific product areas where fi@@ res are likely to occur and require provi@@ sion for an extinguishing capability ( in engine designated Fire Zone ( D@@ FZ ) , combustion heater compartment , APU D@@ FZ , cargo compartments ( AFT , FWD , .. ) ) .
depending on product design and characteristics , the applicable Certification Specifications ( CS ) ( i.e. for Large Aero@@ planes , Large Ro@@ tor@@ craft , Small Ro@@ tor@@ craft , Normal , Utility , Aero@@ ba@@ tic , or Comm@@ u@@ ter Category Aero@@ planes , ... ) and the kind of operations , fire extinguishing systems are either required by CS / S@@ C rules or installed upon applicant initi@@ ative as part of its own safety policies .
subsequently , and still not changed at time of writing , FA@@ R 29.@@ 15@@ 55 ( c ) wor@@ ding was revi@@ si@@ ted with A@@ m@@ d@@ t 29-@@ 12 in FE@@ B / 01 / 19@@ 77 - ( notice of Airworthiness Review Program No. 2 ; notice No. 7@@ 5-@@ 10 ; issued on FE@@ B / 27 / 75 ) as is :
a list of standard terms and Acronyms accepted by certification authorities can be found in Appendix O of RT@@ CA Document DO-@@ 22@@ 9@@ C , Minimum Operational Performance Standard for Global Positioning System / Wide Area augmentation System Airborne Equipment , dated No@@ v@@ emb@@ er 28 , 20@@ 01 .
Section 29.@@ 78@@ 5 ( c ) requires that the restraint system allows crewmembers to perform functions necessary for flight operations while restra@@ ined by the safety belt and shoulder harness . 
the discussion and su@@ g@@ ge@@ sted evaluation procedures for § 29.@@ 7@@ 77 ( b ) of this AC are applicable and should be used for finding compliance with this regulation as well , with the exception that evalu@@ ations must be conducted with crewmembers seated with safety belts and shoulder harnesses fastened . 
additionally , evalu@@ ators should only assess the capability to perform functions necessary for flight operations . 
the certification plan should include a list of those cockpit functions necessary for flight operations , under normal and abnormal conditions . 
as in § 29.@@ 7@@ 77 ( b ) above , consider using in@@ divi@@ du@@ als from a fifth per@@ cen@@ ti@@ le Female and a 9@@ 5@@ th per@@ cen@@ ti@@ le mal@@ e body size to assess compliance .
( D ) ) CAS panels should be easily seen and labels and messages easily le@@ g@@ ible in all lighting conditions . 
the lighting of the panel should balance with the rest of the cockpit .

( 3 ) Se@@ veral pilots and human factors Re@@ presen@@ ta@@ tives should conduct display and system interface evalu@@ ations , particularly when the applicant is installing a system for the first time in a particular category of h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter .

the out@@ come of the fire tests performed on the engine and exhaust composite co@@ w@@ l@@ ings sho@@ wed m@@ arg@@ in@@ al results for the simulated ground condition , with a burn through of the test specimen after 12 min with no air flow instead of the expected 15 min .
Introduction of this kind of extinguishing system architecture may be seen as conflicting with some aircraft requirements like , for in@@ st@@ ance , for independ@@ ence , availability of the number of discharges and compa@@ tibility with the fore@@ seen kind of operations .
for twin engine Large Ro@@ tor@@ craft , it is proposed to install a single multi@@ purpose fire extinguishing system intended to serve the LH engine , the RH engine and the cargo / baggage compartment ( bottle 1 is used for ENG@@ 1 or ENG@@ 2 , bottle 2 is used for ENG@@ 1 or ENG@@ 2 or cargo / baggage compartment ) .
( 3 ) For fuel systems having a calibrated fuel quantity indication system comp@@ lying with SEC . 23.@@ 13@@ 37 ( b ) ( 1 ) and accurately displaying the actual quantity of usable fuel in each selectable tank , no fuel capacity placards outside of the fuel quantity indicator are required
on the concerned Ro@@ tor@@ craft the actual usable fuel capacity for each tank , inc@@ l@@ . the Au@@ x . fuel Tank , is shown both in digital value and graph@@ ically on the fuel quantity indicator on the V@@ M@@ D page of the H@@ eli@@ on@@ ix avionics su@@ i@@ te@@ .@@ This indication complies with FA@@ R / C@@ S@@ 29.@@ 13@@ 37 ( b ) .
such fire testing results do not bring straigh@@ t@@ forward compliance finding to CS 29.@@ 11@@ 93 ( e ) ( 3 ) for the engine and exhaust co@@ w@@ l@@ ings and therefore , an ES@@ F to this requirement is cla@@ im@@ ed for the two composite co@@ w@@ l@@ ings at sta@@ ke .
with reference to the fire testing results obtained ( i.e. 12 min achieved v@@ s. 15 min required ) , the safety intent of the requirement CS 29.@@ 11@@ 93 ( e ) ( 3 ) can be met by demon@@ stra@@ ting that the co@@ w@@ l@@ ings fire with@@ standing capability on ground ensures a safe evacuation of the crew and the passengers and do not en@@ danger ground personal .
the digital fuel quantity indication on the B@@ K@@ 117 D@@ -2 provides the actual usable fuel amount - which is also mo@@ st@@ ly compensated for fuel temperature variation - to the crew directly in digital values ( kg , lit@@ res , ... ) and in addition graph@@ ically .
Con@@ sequ@@ ently , EAS@@ A consider that it results in partial loss of the required C@@ S@@ 29 engine fire extinguishing function due to the use of a common system for the cargo / baggage compartment fire extinguishing function , de@@ sp@@ ite the last is not required per se by C@@ S@@ 29 regulations .
It is acceptable for EAS@@ A provided that the overall Ro@@ tor@@ craft safety balance can be demonstrated with adequate compensating factors for the engine CS 29.@@ 1195 ( b ) ( 2 ) requirement .
these cowling portions ( of mon@@ ol@@ i@@ th@@ ic layup of 5 structural carbon fiber plies ) are very reduced for the design of the engine cowling while they con@@ stitute the majority of the composite structure of the engine exhaust cowling .
as fire occurrence is more likely to occur in the engine compartment ( designated Fire Zone ) rather than in the exhaust area ( separated by firewall from the engine compartment ) , the risk exposure is reduced .
with respect to CS 29.@@ 1@@ 187 ( b ) , the air re@@ ne@@ w@@ al within the engine compartment is higher than the recommended ratio ( for C@@ S-@@ 25 aircraft ) , which minimizes the persi@@ sten@@ ce of flammable vapo@@ ur and the fire re-ignition risk ,
the P3 pipes are fireproof , therefore their integrity in case of engine compartment fire ensures that no P3 air flow would add any hazard to an existing fire by deli@@ vering hot pressurized air on an existing fire ,
this includes , but is not limited to , part computer ai@@ ded design ( CA@@ D ) files , test specimen geometry files , the assembled part build file ( parts , test specimens , and support structures ) , ste@@ re@@ ol@@ i@@ tho@@ graphy ( ST@@ L ) files , sl@@ ice files , parameter files , log files , and execution sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts .
further to the above mentioned design compensating factors , the following elements resulting from the introduction of a cargo fire extinguishing system are considered as additional safety benef@@ its at h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter level :
opportunity for the crew to leave a ho@@ sti@@ le environment in case of cargo fire , this will reduce the exposure to Hazardous situation that may result from a landing / ditching in such ho@@ sti@@ le environment .
the H@@ 160 power@@ plant installation architecture is such that the co@@ w@@ l@@ ings are above the engine compartment , which is located on top of the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , above the cargo compartment , with the M@@ GB compartment in front , and the rear transmission compartment behind .
the possibility to use an engine fire bottle to treat a fire in the cargo / baggage compartment leads to LIMIT duration OF FLIGHT in safer condition ( A@@ E@@ O flight ) than in case of one engine fire event ( O@@ E@@ I flight ) .
A@@ H@@ D is of the op@@ ini@@ on that the digital fuel quantity indication as currently done on B@@ K@@ 117 D@@ -2 ( and EC@@ 135 and B@@ K@@ 117 C@@ -2 ) together with the placard at the filler port provides an equivalent level of safety to the requirement of FA@@ R / C@@ S@@ 29.@@ 15@@ 55 ( c ) ( 1 ) .
it means in case of fire on ground and burn through of the co@@ w@@ l@@ ings , that the flames are not expected to reach the passenger compartment nor other compartments where flammable fluid are stored , such as :
risk of inadvertent triggering of the cargo extinguishing system by the crew in an emergency situation , which would be de@@ tri@@ mental to engine fire extinguishing system availability , is also minim@@ ized by the design arrangement of the overhead control panel where cargo fire the extinguishing push-button is well separated from the engine fire extinguishing controls .
there were also product where anal@@ og@@ ue fuel gauge information , with limited accuracy / range im@@ posed a marking / placard with usable total fuel capacity in order to be able to assess the actual fuel quantity by the anal@@ og@@ ue indicator .
another compensating factor is the improved possibility to fight fi@@ res when on the ground , because not only the two on-@@ board extinguishing systems are useful against engine fi@@ res , but also any other available fire extinguishing device ( such as cabin extinguishers or handheld extinguishers from the air@@ field or h@@ el@@ i@@ pad or fire@@ m@@ en presence ) can be used as additional fi@@ ref@@ ighting means on ground .
based on the regulatory review , it is assumed that initial rule inten@@ d , where fuel quantity indication was performed by anal@@ og@@ ue fuel gauge di@@ als , was to ensure that the total amount of usable fuel available can be determined by looking at the fuel quantity indicator , for in@@ st@@ ance , marked in frac@@ tional / percentage tank units and referenced to the maximum fuel tank capacity marked next / at the fuel quantity indicator .
the cowling fire@@ pro@@ o@@ f@@ ness ( subject to 15@@ min standard flame exposure ) to be demonstrated for ground and flight conditions , has not been fully achieved for the ground condition .
agreed as 5min in simulated ENGINE ON condition , i.e. with induced air flow in air inlet , then followed by 10@@ min in simulated ENGINE OFF condition , i.e. with no induced air flow .
even if the reduction of the engine fire extinguishing system availability may be considered as significant , in practice , as the independ@@ en@@ cy of the cargo and engine fire events will be demonstrated , the reduction of this availability associated to an actual engine fire is ne@@ gl@@ ig@@ ible on the A / C overall safety , h@@ ence lower than the typical reliability of a standard fire extinguishing system .
the recent F@@ AR@@ 23 rule e@@ vol@@ ution is reli@@ e@@ ving a fuel quantity system indicator giving an accurate and direct reading of actual usable fuel quantity from having the permanent / fix information of the usable fuel capacity .
EAS@@ A do recognize that , during flight , the usable fuel quantity awareness remains of higher impor@@ tance than the usable fuel capacity ( of a full fuel tank ) , unless this capacity is necessary to define the usable fuel quantity .
a request for an Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding ( ES@@ F ) was submitted to EAS@@ A in order to increase the Maximum Passenger Se@@ ating Capacity ( MP@@ S@@ C ) of a dual aisle aircraft beyond the MP@@ S@@ C value of 440 which is obtained according to the CS 25.@@ 807 ( g ) at C@@ S-@@ 25 am@@ en@@ d@@ ment 20 .
therefore , the digital fuel quantity indication on the B@@ K@@ 117 D@@ -2 that provides the actual usable fuel amount accurately , i.@@ e compensated for fuel temperature variation , allowing information presen@@ tation to the crew directly in digital values ( kg , lit@@ res , ... ) and graph@@ ically is an acceptable compensating factor .
Type A emergency exits were intro@@ duced by the FAA into FA@@ R 25.@@ 807 with A@@ m@@ d@@ t 15 ( 19@@ 67 ) , with a cre@@ di@@ t of 100 passenger seats per pair of exits , which was subsequently increased to 110 with FA@@ R 25 A@@ m@@ d@@ t 39 ( 19@@ 77 ) .
if there is a means to control the rotation of the rotor drive system independently of the engine , any limitations on the use of that means must be specified , and the control for that means must be gu@@ ar@@ ded to prevent inadvertent operation .
No@@ tw@@ i@@ th@@ standing the impro@@ ve@@ ments intro@@ duced in the me@@ anti@@ me in the state of the art Type A emergency exit design ( e.g. escape slides performance , door opening time , etc . ) , EAS@@ A does still consider the maximum number of passenger seats ( i.e. 110 ) allowed by CS 25.@@ 807 ( g ) per pair of Type A emergency exits as appropriate .
the applicant inten@@ ds not to comply with C@@ S.@@ 25 807 ( g ) and to compensate this by taking cre@@ di@@ t for a higher number of passenger seats per pair of Type A exit through the introduction of design and operational requirements over and above those associated with a Type A exit .
c@@ .2 ) Control guard mechanisms to prevent inadvertent operation may be conventional . a cockpit evaluation of the guard should be conducted by flight test personnel to af@@ firm the function of the guard , that markings , if any , are adequate , and that both latched and un@@ latched positions of the guard do not interfere with other cockpit functions .
all significant process changes to frozen process specifications must under@@ go a similar qualification to that of the initial process valid@@ ation described above prior to their introduction in the manufacturing process .
according to the applicant , such Type A + emergency exits will feature the following impro@@ ve@@ ments with the aim to ease the formation of two parallel evacuation lines and facilitate the transition from door sill to slide :
the previously g@@ ran@@ ted F@@ AR@@ 23 / F@@ AR@@ 29 E@@ LO@@ S de@@ sp@@ ite placards or markings were either not present or present but not placed at the quantity indicator or present but not permanently displayed ( numeric display ) had in common use of numerical fuel system displays .
the direct digital fuel quantity system compliance to CS 29.@@ 13@@ 37 ( b ) and its compliance demon@@ stration using AC 29.@@ 13@@ 37 , that establi@@ shes criteria for gauging accuracy and zero calibration to the unusable fuel quantity , are dee@@ med con@@ tri@@ but@@ ing to provide an accurate and readily fuel quantity information to the crew .
Note : ET@@ SO@@ -@@ C@@ 69@@ c was issued on 24@@ th Oc@@ to@@ ber 200@@ 3 , therefore the imple@@ mentation of Type A + emergency exits on large aero@@ plane models certified before that date will result in the need to improve the slide design .
the Assessment should consider proximity to other controls and identification means of the rotor brake control system ( co@@ lo@@ ur co@@ ding , labels , shape of the controls , direction of motion , vi@@ sibility in day and night operations , etc )
material strength and design values used for AM components that require structural analysis need to account for the vari@@ ability due to the materials and the production methods used to manufacture the part .
in general the vari@@ ability of the material in the final component is ac@@ coun@@ ted for by using sta@@ tis@@ tical tools to analyze data obtained from testing of specimens either extracted from actual components , or in cases where specimens cannot be extracted from actual components , purpose built specimens .
in compliance with CS 29.@@ 67 ( a ) ( 1 ) , during this first climb segment , a minimum of 100 fpm rate of climb ( Ro@@ C ) is to be guaran@@ te@@ ed with the 2 min O@@ E@@ I power , with the landing gear down and a speed of V@@ TO@@ SS .
the applicant inten@@ ds to demon@@ st@@ rate through an extensive testing c@@ amp@@ a@@ ign that the Type A + emergency exit definition given above has an increased performance compared to a Type A emergency exit and therefore can be considered adequate to allow transportation of more than 110 passengers per Type A + exit pair .
as per AC@@ 27.@@ 115@@ 1 this means is intended to prevent inadvertent brake application in flight even under conditions of reason@@ ably expected crew error and should provide a signal at any time the rotor brake is engaged .
the design features included in the proposed Type A + emergency exit definition provide for an increased evacuation performance compared to a design meeting the requirements for a Type A emergency exit .
in compliance with CS 29.@@ 67 ( a ) ( 2 ) , during this second climb segment , at least 150 fpm Ro@@ C must be guaran@@ te@@ ed at Maximum Continuous Power O@@ E@@ I ( M@@ CP O@@ E@@ I ) , with landing gear up and with a speed selected by the applicant .
EAS@@ A therefore accep@@ ts an ES@@ F for CS 25.@@ 807 ( g ) , allowing an increase of the number of passenger seats for each pair of Type A + emergency exits but not beyond 120 passenger seats , provided that the requirements reported below are met .
( a ) The Type A + emergency exit shall meet all the requirements applicable to Type A emergency exits included in CS 25.@@ 807 , 25.@@ 809 , 25.@@ 810 , 25.@@ 811 , 25.@@ 812 and 25.@@ 813 am@@ d@@ t . 20 , and all relevant Special Conditions and Equivalent Safety findings as per the applicable type certification basis .
this ES@@ F pro@@ po@@ ses a way to meet the intent of CS 29.@@ 15@@ 87 ( a ) ( 6 ) for Category A continued take-off and bal@@ ked landing procedures alternative to those prescribed in CS 29.@@ 59 , CS 29.@@ 60 ( continued take-off ) and CS 29.@@ 85 ( bal@@ ked landing ) requirements .
these alternative procedures may comple@@ ment or replace the procedures where the first segment is completed at a height of 200 ft ATS or , in the case of a bal@@ ked landing , at the height selected by the applicant ( he@@ rea@@ fter called conventional procedures ) and they may be adopted by the flight crew in case the need for obstacles clearance becomes a factor .
while for the continued take-off and bal@@ ked landing alternative procedures are proposed as an alternative to the conventional ones , the A@@ E@@ O take-off and landing and the landing O@@ E@@ I procedures remain un@@ al@@ tered .
what are the key types of material an@@ om@@ al@@ ies ( e.g. , porosity , lack of fusion , etc . ) that may result in component performance de@@ bit ( e.g. , tensile properties , low cycle fatigue , high cycle fatigue ) ?
in the original Type Certification design , four inspection holes are present on the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter passenger doors , in order to allow direct inspection of the locks and evaluate the state of the door locking system .
( F ) For the cabin crew members required by ( e ) , procedures shall be specified in order to ensure that two cabin crew members are able to occu@@ py the assist spaces available at one of the two doors of the Type A + emergency exit pair .
in order to restore the possibility to perform the visual check , four devices , utilizing fi@@ b@@ re-@@ op@@ tic technology , are located inside the door lin@@ ers , to restore a visual mean of the actual door engagement .
for the climb portion above a height of 200 ft and until the acceleration to a speed of V@@ Y is started , the published gra@@ di@@ ents will be based on the 2 min O@@ E@@ I power , instead of the O@@ E@@ I M@@ CP , as required by CS 29.@@ 67 ( a ) ( 2 ) ;
there must be means for direct visual inspection of the locking mechanism by crew members to determine whether the external doors ( including passenger , crew , service , and cargo doors ) are fully locked .
system installation and maintenance - The system installation and con@@ sequ@@ ent maintenance activity have been verified to not be pr@@ one to any human error by providing check points over the installation phases .
Ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , according to 2@@ 1.@@ A@@ .@@ 101 ( e ) 1 . ( I ) , it is possible to demon@@ st@@ rate that any airworthiness provisions not comp@@ lied with are compensated for by factors that provide an equivalent level of safety .
Ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , according to point 2@@ 1.@@ B@@ .@@ 80 ( a ) ( 2 ) of P@@ art@@ -@@ 21 ( An@@ ne@@ x I to Regulation ( E@@ U ) No 7@@ 48 / 2012 ) , it is possible to demon@@ st@@ rate that any airworthiness provisions not comp@@ lied with are compensated for by factors that provide an equivalent level of safety .
they will be able to take steps to maintain balanced evacu@@ ee flow to all usable exits , and they will be able to better detect and take steps to prevent undesirable activity such as passengers attempting to retrie@@ ve bags from overhead stow bins .
can the applicant provide a matrix ( e.g. , number of heats , lots , specimens for each specimen type , orientation , location on build plate , surface texture , and condition ) that su@@ mm@@ ar@@ izes the testing performed to develop the mechanical , fatigue , fracture mechan@@ ics , and other design values ?
( B ) It shall be demonstrated by test that the increase in evacuation performance of the Type A + emergency exit with respect to that of a Type A emergency exit is achieved regardless of the outside lighting conditions .
the maximum number of passenger seats permitted for each pair of Type A + emergency exits ( a pair being two emergency exits , one installed on each side of the fuselage ) will not be above 120 , ir@@ respective of the demonstrated increase in performance .
considering that P@@ B@@ F methods are best su@@ ited to produce smaller , typically thin walled components it may be difficult to extract test specimens represen@@ tative of the mechanical properties of that component .
the testing c@@ amp@@ a@@ ign shall be designed to identify the added value given by the design and operational impro@@ ve@@ ments of the Type A + , individually ( e.g. cabin crew members required by ( 1 . ( E ) ) or in combination ( e.g. design features required by ( 1 . ( B ) ) ) .
an adequate definition of the actions to be taken by the flight crew in case of an unlocked indication , considering that the flight crew display is not in itself adequate compensation to allow the dispatch of the aircraft
in these cases an AC@@ O engineer may have to assess the strength and design values being proposed by an applicant in a manner similar to the building block approach used for composite materials ( Composite Materials Handbook 17 ) .
? composite Design Value : structural properties that are determined from test data at the laminate or lamin@@ a level on a probability basis ( e.g. , A or B basis values , with 99 % probability and 95 % confidence , or 90 % probability and 95 % confidence , respectively ) .
a full investig@@ ation to ensure that there are no mechanical means ( e.g. wear , tolerance etc ) which would allow the fi@@ b@@ re-@@ op@@ tic beam to pass through and give a fal@@ se-@@ positive indication that the door is locked when it is not .
an adequate demon@@ stration that the light remains easy to see , for example in bright sunlight and / or when the indicator is not viewed directly ( accep@@ ting that the in@@ ability to see the light should nec@@ ess@@ itate further investig@@ ations being performed ) .
considering all the above , the Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding to CS 29.@@ 78@@ 3 ( e ) at A@@ m@@ d@@ t . 2 in Appendix A was subject to public consultation from A@@ pri@@ l 6 , 20@@ 21 to A@@ pri@@ l 27 , 20@@ 21 and is finally adopted with the changes as a result of the comments from the public .
systems Interface - The fi@@ b@@ re-@@ op@@ tic light system is fully independent from the visual means provided by the Primary Flight Display ( PFD ) to signal to the flight crew members when normally used external doors are closed and fully locked .
the engine compartment fire detectors have their electrical circuit tested during the pre-@@ flight test .
and the system design is such to ensure that - even with a subsequent un@@ detected failure of the engine fire detector system during one flight - the probability of an un@@ detected engine fire , is Extremely Impro@@ bable .
while the initial scope of this rule could not be docu@@ mented , one could reason@@ ably interpre@@ t it as to allow crew members to perform a test - in flight - in order to minimize as much as possible the risk of un@@ detected fire due to a fire detector system electrical circuit failure .
the purpose of this policy sta@@ tement is to cl@@ ar@@ ify that certain life-limited items , in addition to those specifically required by 14 C@@ FR section 27.@@ 571 or 29.@@ 571 , should be included in the Airworthiness Limitations Section ( ALS ) of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness ( IC@@ A ) for Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
thus the occupants can detect a door po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally being unlocked even in case the visual system that is available to the flight crew on the PFD is mis@@ lead@@ ing@@ ly providing the indication that the door is closed and fully locked .
Appendix A of both 14 C@@ FR part 27 and part 29 states that the ALS must set forth each mandatory replacement time , structural inspection interval , and related structural inspection procedure approved under § 27.@@ 571 or § 29.@@ 571 , as applicable .
histor@@ ically , the Ro@@ tor@@ craft Direc@@ to@@ rate and Aircraft Certification Off@@ ices who manage Ro@@ tor@@ craft type certific@@ ates have approved and included in the ALS additional life-limited components not approved under § 27.@@ 571 or § 29.@@ 571 .
system cri@@ ticality and related reliability - The design reliability has been verified to be co@@ m@@ men@@ su@@ rate with the cri@@ ticality level of the failure conditions determined at h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter and system levels ( e.g. door ) .
failure conditions that are evaluated shall also consider the effects of moisture , temperature , vibrations , and the partial or full part detach@@ ing of components from the complete door locking system including deformation of such components .
ground test - A ground test has been performed to ensure that there is no passenger and crew position in the cabin that might lead to a mis@@ leading indication of the door being locked wh@@ il@@ st the door is still open .
however , to help cl@@ ar@@ ify that other life limits can be included in the ALS , we are currently processing a ru@@ le@@ making pro@@ po@@ sal to delete approved under § 27.@@ 571 or § 29.@@ 571 , depending on the section and to insert required for type certification in Appendix A for both A@@ 27.@@ 4 and A@@ 29.@@ 4 .
that section must set forth each mandatory replacement time , inspection interval , and related procedure established during certification for the airplane or any part there@@ of .
Note : the final rule was incorporated as Appendix G to part 23 and not Appendix F to part 23 .
( a ) The increase in performance of a Type A + emergency exit with respect to that of a Type A emergency exit shall be quanti@@ fied and demonstrated through compara@@ tive testing , taking into account also the different performance of emergency exits located at the ends of the cabin ( fed by two flows ) and in the middle of the cabin ( fed by three flows ) .
this interpre@@ tation would be confirmed by AC@@ 29-@@ 2C : the detector system should be designed for highest reliability to detect a fire and not to give a false alarm . and If the probability of the fire detection system experi@@ en@@ cing a false indication cannot be shown to be Impro@@ bable , a secondary means of determining the val@@ idity of the fire indication should be provided .
even though this policy does not require the FAA to follow it in the same manner as we would be required to follow a regulation , this policy is how the FAA exp@@ ec@@ ts to de@@ al , generally , with placing items in the ALS of the ICA@@ s for Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
this policy sta@@ tement provides guidance to ensure compli@@ ant and safe ibf installations and identifies items that should be considered when installing an ibf in a Ro@@ tor@@ craft , such as the determination of power available and the evaluation of the alternate air source system .
the Weight Altitude Temperature ( W@@ AT ) charts published in the RFM will be determined by im@@ po@@ sing a minimum Ro@@ C at 2 minute O@@ E@@ I ( landing gear down for the first segment and landing up for the second segment ) as limiting factors with sufficient safety margin with respect to the one requested by CS 29.@@ 67 ( a ) ( 1 ) and 29.@@ 67 ( a ) ( 2 ) .
as a result of this policy , applic@@ ants have been conducting the special Electromagnetic Interference ( EMI ) testing add@@ ressed in the policy on many different Ro@@ tor@@ craft models equipped with critical controls such as Full Authority Digital Engine Control ( FADEC ) .
in order to demon@@ st@@ rate that the procedures can be implemented in the entire Category A take-off and landing envelope before expi@@ ration of the 2 minute O@@ E@@ I rating , it has been verified with flight test data that sufficient residual time before the expi@@ ration of 2 minute O@@ E@@ I rating is always available to accelerate to V@@ Y , even in the corners of the envelope .
normal procedures will be presented considering the new approach , specifically the normal procedures will require to carry out the climb to a height of 1000 ft ATS at V@@ CO@@ SS and at a Ro@@ C that guaran@@ tees equal or ste@@ e@@ per gra@@ di@@ ents than the emergency procedure .
this type must have a rectangular opening of not less than 0.48 m wide by 0.@@ 66 m ( 19 inches wide by 26 inches ) high , with corner radii not greater than one third the width of the exit , in the side of the fuselage with a step up inside the Ro@@ tor@@ craft of not more than 0.7@@ 4 m ( 29 inches ) .
G@@ radi@@ ents for the first segment will be published in the performance section in the conditions prescribed by CS 29.@@ 67 ( a ) ( 1 ) , while for the second segment the gra@@ di@@ ents will be determined at V@@ CO@@ SS / 2 minute O@@ E@@ I , rather than in the conditions prescribed by CS 29.@@ 67 ( a ) ( 2 ) .
C ) It is demonstrated that the alternative procedures can be flown without the need for exce@@ p@@ tional pi@@ lo@@ ting skill using the O@@ E@@ I counter as a reference to determine the time to start the acceleration from a speed of V@@ TO@@ SS to V@@ Y .
D ) In the case of the continued take-off , it is demonstrated that the alternative procedures are defined as those being critical for obstacles clearance . 
the takeoff flight path for a normal A@@ E@@ O takeoff does not descend below the flight path determined by the alternative climb procedure .
this requirement assu@@ mes that a single opening , meeting or exceeding the criteria specified above , would correspond to a single passenger emergency exit allowing evacuation of only one passenger at a time .
information : Certification Guidelines for Compliance to the Requirements for Electro@@ -@@ Magnetic compa@@ tibility ( EM@@ C ) Testing for Equipment known to Ha@@ ve a High potential for Interference when Installed on Ro@@ tor@@ craft with Electronic Controls that provide Critical Functions
the here@@ by presented Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding has been classified as important and as such shall be subject to public consultation , in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board Decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) , which states :
E ) The set of RFM instructions and associated cockpit indications provided to the flight crew are evaluated so that likely errors in determining the correct time to accelerate to a speed of V@@ Y at the end of the extended first climb segment are ass@@ essed and they do not imp@@ air safety .
when defin@@ ing a Category A take-off procedure , as prescribed by CS 29.@@ 59 and 29.@@ 60 , the take-off path must be such that a height of 1000 ft Above Surface Level ( AS@@ L ) is reached through 2 climb segments :
purpose : on Mar@@ ch 31 , 19@@ 98 , the FAA Ro@@ tor@@ craft Direc@@ to@@ rate issued a policy letter on Certification Guidelines for Compliance to the Requirements for Electro@@ -@@ Magnetic compa@@ tibility ( EM@@ C ) Testing for Non-@@ Qu@@ al@@ if@@ ied Equipment and Equipment known to Ha@@ ve a High potential for Interference when Installed on Ro@@ tor@@ craft with Electronic Controls that provide Critical Functions . 
the policy issued on Mar@@ ch 31 , 19@@ 98 , was reviewed and co@@ m@@ mented on by other FAA off@@ ices and indu@@ stry .
a ) The RFM emergency procedures section includes adequate instructions for the flight crew to fly the alternative procedures . whenever the alternative procedures can be implemented , they replace the conventional ones .
when reaching a height of 1000 ft AS@@ L , sufficient time will be remaining to allow a level flight acceleration to V@@ Y before the 2 minute O@@ E@@ I rating expi@@ ration ( 150 fpm Ro@@ C will be still available at V@@ Y and M@@ CP O@@ E@@ I , 1000 ft AS@@ L ) .
also , because the airworthiness standards and Ro@@ tor@@ craft AC@@ s do not specifically address ibf installations , this policy cap@@ tures guidance docu@@ mented for these installations in pro@@ ject specific issue pa@@ pers and supp@@ lements the existing guidance to address the unique characteristics of ibf installations .
accordingly , CS 29.@@ 15@@ 87 ( a ) ( 6 ) requires the publication of the first and second segment climb gra@@ di@@ ents in the performance section of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft Flight Manual ( RFM ) , in order to allow the crew to determine the take-off path and guarantee obstacle clearance .
in the frame of the certification of a new engine installation , while for certain Category A take-off procedures the conventional take-off path is established as defined in C@@ S-@@ 29 , for some other procedures the applicant is pro@@ po@@ sing a new take-off path .
C ) These additional performance charts , along with those provided for the acceleration up to V@@ TO@@ SS and positive rate of climb , for the first and second climb segments allow the determination of the entire take-off and bal@@ ked landing paths and obstacles clearance as per the conventional procedures .
in the certification basis of the product for which this ES@@ F is applicable , AM@@ C 29 General states that the AM@@ C to C@@ S-@@ 29 consists of FAA AC 29-@@ 2C - Change 4 dated 1 May 20@@ 14 with the changes / ad@@ di@@ tions that are given in book 2 of C@@ S-@@ 29 .
the alternative procedures extend the duration of the climb at a speed of V@@ TO@@ SS and therefore provide additional time for the flight crew to properly establish the climb before accele@@ rating to a speed of V@@ Y .
a ) The take-off and landing envelope within which the alternative procedures can be carried out is defined . it is par@@ amount to consider for the envelope determination , the residual 2 min O@@ E@@ I time that remains available when crossing a height of 200 ft ATS in case of a continued take-off or when the flight crew is required to accelerate to a speed of V@@ Y in case of a bal@@ ked landing . 
this residual time must allow the Ro@@ tor@@ craft to continue to climb in the same conditions and level flight acceleration to a speed of V@@ Y before the 2 min O@@ E@@ I power rating is used up in all combinations of ambient conditions and Ro@@ tor@@ craft weights for which the approval is required . 
while determining the take-off and landing envelope , the effects of external kits or other installations that could affect the installed power should also be considered .
the AM@@ C to CS 29.@@ 67 provided in FAA AC 29-@@ 2C Change 4 AC 29.@@ 67 ( b ) ( 1 ) con@@ temp@@ lates and en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ges selecting a single c@@ li@@ m@@ bo@@ ut speed , independent from weight and ambient conditions for the second climb segment in order to simp@@ lif@@ y cockpit procedures .
Ah has requested an ES@@ F to the CS 29.@@ 807 ( a ) ( 4 ) to demon@@ st@@ rate that the single window of each cabin sliding door provides emergency evacuation capabilities at least equivalent , in terms of size and availability , to what would be provided by two Type IV passenger emergency exits installed side by side .
in this new take-off path , after V@@ TO@@ SS ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion , the crew is requested to continue climbing and accele@@ rating to V@@ CO@@ SS ( Cli@@ mb@@ -@@ Out Safety Speed ) - a speed that is mid@@ way between V@@ TO@@ SS and V@@ Y - using the 2 minute O@@ E@@ I power and maintaining V@@ CO@@ SS and 2 minute O@@ E@@ I power throughout the second segment profile .
however , if , according to the new take-off path , the second segment climb gra@@ di@@ ents published in the RFM are based on the 2 minute O@@ E@@ I power , this pro@@ po@@ sal would be li@@ te@@ rally not compli@@ ant to CS 29.@@ 15@@ 87 ( a ) ( 6 ) ( II ) since this CS requires determination of the gra@@ di@@ ents based on the maximum continuous power ( M@@ CP ) O@@ E@@ I .
since the guidance material presented in this policy sta@@ tement is not regulatory , terms having a mandatory definition , such as  shall and must , etc . , as used in this policy sta@@ tement , apply either to the re@@ i@@ te@@ ration of a regulation itself , or to an applicant who cho@@ o@@ ses to follow a prescribed method of compliance without deviation .
this means that the ignition systems shall be controlled separately , so that each circuit operation can be checked separately and circuits selected or deactivated individually in the event of an ignition system malfunction .
as a pre@@ requi@@ site to the equivalent safety finding , the applicant shall demon@@ st@@ rate that the new take-off path can be flown in the entire Category A take-off and landing envelope with sufficient residual time before expi@@ ration of the 2 minute O@@ E@@ I power and that is compli@@ ant with the Category A performance requirements sp@@ ef@@ c@@ if@@ ied in C@@ S-@@ 29 Sub@@ part B .
Mo@@ re@@ over , the safety intent of the CS can be met if the RFM performance data is consistent with the proposed new take-off path and provides information to the crew with the same level of safety as for a conventional procedure ( in terms of presen@@ tation of the data , identification of the O@@ E@@ I power and speed for which they are valid ) to allow the determination of distances and obstacles clearance .
excessive ibf blockage could reduce available power and wor@@ s@@ en inlet distortion , resulting in higher measured gas temperatures , surge , stall , engine flameout , or pre@@ mature failure of engine components .
additionally , the physical close proximity of installed equipment to electronic controls that provide critical functions is inherent due to the smaller size of most Ro@@ tor@@ craft and represents a greater potential for interference than for larger fixed wing aircraft .
a h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter currently under type certification , with two electronically controlled turbine engines ( each engine is controlled by means of a distinct Electronic Engine Control Unit - E@@ ECU ) , is provi@@ sion@@ ed with a STOP / IDLE / FLIGHT ( S / I / F ) switch per engine .
the objective is to provide better obstacles clearance when compared to a conventional procedure due the fact that the level flight or positive Ro@@ C acceleration from a speed of V@@ TO@@ SS to V@@ Y occurs at a higher height .
the here@@ by-@@ presented Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding has been classified as an important Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding and as such shall be subject to public consultation , in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) of which states :
the ibf system must be designed to properly function throughout the operating envelope ( including vibration , temperature , airspeed , and altitude ) and with a vari@@ ety of airborne particles such as salt , snow , ice , sand , and gra@@ ss .
within some installation of fuel shut-off valves the fuel shut-off valve is mounted to the firewall with the main body on the external side of the firewall with a part of the valve protruding in the designated fire zone .
for h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ters to be certified in compliance with airworthiness criteria for instrument flight , C@@ S-@@ 29 , in Appendix B par@@ a . VI@@ II . , point ( c ) , requires that in addition to the instrument lights required by CS 29.@@ 13@@ 81 ( a ) , thunderstorm lights which provide high intensity white flood lighting to the basic flight instruments must be provided .
under any fire condition in the designated Fire Zone , the operation of the shut-off valve when subject to fire conditions is to be maintained for the first 5 minutes , and remain in closed position for at least the 10 following minutes .
analysis , ground tests , and flight tests used to show an ibf installation complies with § § 27.@@ 45 or 29.@@ 45 must utili@@ ze the approved engine power and should be with the filter clogged at the impending blockage level throughout the proposed flight envelope and at the most critical engine condition such as takeoff or maximum one engine inoperative ( O@@ E@@ I ) con@@ t@@ ing@@ en@@ cy power .
such additional lights are intended to provide a means to prevent the effect of pilot da@@ zz@@ ling or temporary b@@ lin@@ ding by lightning discharge while the Ro@@ tor@@ craft is being operated under thunderstorm conditions so@@ le@@ ly by reference to instruments .
Compara@@ tive flight testing between the un@@ modified inlet and the ibf installation throughout the proposed operating envelope is one means of determining the performance imp@@ ac@@ ts relative to § § 27.@@ 45 or 29.@@ 45 .
the impending blockage level is set by the applicant and represents the grea@@ test amount of filter blockage at which pilot action is not required ( that is , just prior to cockpit annunciation of a clogged filter ) .
- capability for the crew to conduct the flight and manage both normal ( ground start ) and ab@@ n@@ or@@ m al situations ( i.e. adverse weather conditions , in-flight restart ) and / or any limitations ( i.e. engine , operational ) , either by crew action and / or by system b
they allow to reduce the lighting levels contrast between the inside of the cockpit and the outside of the aircraft in case of a flash of lightning , by locally increasing the cockpit illumination in the area where the basic flight instruments are installed and on which the pilot eyes are primarily foc@@ used during IFR flight .
a satisfactory PAC using the power assurance charts must ensure the ability of the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter to achieve performance as docu@@ mented in the flight manual after ac@@ coun@@ ting for ibf losses ( ibf flight manual performance ) .
this helps natural eyes re-@@ ada@@ ption to the cockpit lighting environment and prompt sens@@ or@@ ial per@@ ce@@ ption recovery of the most intensi@@ vely lighted zone of the basic flight instruments as illuminated by the thunderstorm lights .
more rig@@ oro@@ us testing is required to satisfy the concern for the installation of equipment that would interfere with the critical control ( e.g. , FADEC , fly-by-wire , etc . ) or failure management of the critical control .
O@@ rig@@ in@@ ally , the requirement of additional thunderstorm lights ai@@ med at ADDRES@@ SING traditional h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter co@@ ck@@ pits equipped of anal@@ og@@ ical instruments lighted by either low intensity in@@ te@@ gra@@ te@@ d-@@ lights or external cockpit lighting system .
an acceptable extra@@ po@@ lation of the partial power assurance data should be valid@@ ated to ensure that the approved engine power can still be obtained for clo@@ gging levels up to the impending blockage level annunciation .
some aspec@@ ts of ground and flight testing may require direct assistance and information from the engine and airframe manufacturers , such as utilization of engine performance predic@@ tion computer programs , installation effects , and flight test instru@@ mentation .
the Boeing Model 737@@ -7 , 737@@ -8 and 737@@ -@@ 9 ( 737 MAX ) airplanes will use a fu@@ el@@ ling float switch in each fuel tank to provide automatic shutoff of pressure fu@@ el@@ ling , via a fu@@ el@@ ling shutoff valve , when the fuel tanks have reached full capacity .
sections 27.@@ 45 ( c ) and 29.@@ 45 ( c ) require that ibf flight manual performance must be based on the approved engine power corrected for all installation losses , which includes the ibf clogged to the impending blockage level .
the following Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding has been classified as an important Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding and as such shall be subject to public consultation , in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) of which states :
Fur@@ ther@@ more , it is arg@@ u@@ ed that an increased external illumination of screens where the basic flight instruments are displayed might rather imp@@ air the contrast of their s@@ y@@ m@@ bo@@ logy and the overall parameters rea@@ da@@ bility , or cause de@@ tri@@ mental reflec@@ tions even though the displays are typically provided with anti@@ glare and anti@@ reflection coatings .
this class of equipment is equipment known to have a high potential for interference , which may or may not be qualified to an aircraft standard , such as high frequency ( HF ) radios , high powered ra@@ d@@ ars , hoists , transmitting antennas located near the controls systems , etc .
the engine power docu@@ mented in the T@@ CD@@ S is also referred to as minimum specification engine power . a minimum un@@ installed specification engine is one that , on a test stand under conditions specified by the engine manufacturer , will produce the certificated hor@@ se@@ power values at specification temperatures and speeds .
this is intended to ensure that the parts and assemblies are appropriately designed , identified and trac@@ eable according to the cri@@ ticality of their failure effect and therefore the external / HE@@ C load shall not be lost un@@ inten@@ tionally .
contamination of the fu@@ el@@ ling float switch by moisture or fuel , and chaf@@ ing of the float switch wiring in the condu@@ it could present an ignition source inside the fuel tank that could cause a fire or explosion .
although individual engines will typically produce more power , and h@@ ence have margin to allow them to remain in service for extended periods , engine manufacturers must del@@ i@@ ver engines that produce at least minimum specification engine power , and this power - less installation losses - establi@@ shes the aircraft performance included in the flight manual .
the float switch wiring and condu@@ it installation on the Model 737 MAX airplanes is not a fail@@ safe design , and therefore , it does not directly comply with CS 25.@@ 901 ( c ) , 25.@@ 9@@ 81 ( a ) ( 3 ) and 25.1309 ( b ) ( 1 ) .
since aircraft performance must be based on installed minimum specification engine power , it is not acceptable to simp@@ ly subtract the additional ibf installation loss from the margin ( that is , the power above minimum specification power for a particular engine ) .
when cla@@ im@@ ed to not install thunderstorm lights , EAS@@ A has agreed that demon@@ stration of an Equivalent Safety Fin@@ ding to the requirement C@@ S-@@ 29 Appendix B par@@ a . VI@@ II . , point ( c ) , can be shown on the basis of the following compensating factors :
the overload clutch of the hoists cla@@ im@@ ed for certification is subject to EAS@@ A AD 20@@ 13-@@ 0@@ 27@@ 5@@ R1 ste@@ mm@@ ing from the investig@@ ation on an in-service event where a failure of the rescue hoist slip clutch resulted in the hoist cable to re@@ el-@@ out in an un@@ controlled manner .
the here@@ by presented equivalent safety finding shall be subject to public consultation , in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) of which states :
accomplishment : in addition to the following special testing considerations add@@ ressed in paragraphs 7 and 8 , EMI Installation Testing for Critical Controls and Installation Test Conditions , all installed equipment should under@@ go a cross-@@ matrix operational check for EM@@ C considerations by operating all equipment under consideration and determining if an interference hazard is created .
if an applicant requests to use a pro@@ gress@@ ive filter blockage monitor to account for installation losses associated with filter blockage ( performance cre@@ di@@ t ) , it will be considered on a ca@@ se-@@ by-@@ case basis and docu@@ mented in an Issue Paper .
- No@@ tw@@ i@@ th@@ standing compliance with the requirements of CS 29.@@ 7@@ 71 ( a ) , CS 29.@@ 773 ( a ) and CS 29.@@ 13@@ 81 , a compara@@ tive sim@@ ulation testing with and without thunderstorm lights must demon@@ st@@ rate that the increased brightness feature of the electronic displays al@@ read
Class of Equipment - Equipment known to Ha@@ ve a High potential for Interference : this class of equipment should be tested in the installation as described in the EMI Installation Testing for Critical Controls / Installation Test Conditions paragraphs 7 and 8 .
the test measuring Halon concentration in the engine compartment was conducted in a pen@@ alizing configuration , which represents an additional margin with respect to the expected Halon concentration with serial design ,
2 . Deviations from the applicable airworthiness codes , environmental protection certification specifications and / or acceptable means of compliance with Part 21 , as well as important special conditions and equivalent safety findings , shall be submitted to the panel of ex@@ per@@ ts and be subject to a public consultation of at least 3 weeks , except if they have been previously agreed and published in the Off@@ ic@@ ial Publication of the A@@ gency . 
the final decision shall be published in the Off@@ ic@@ ial Publication of the A@@ gency .
in comp@@ lying with § § 27.@@ 901 ( c ) and 29.@@ 901 ( b ) ( 1 ) , the ibf installation must comply with the engine manufacturer approved installation instructions , including inlet distortion , and any applicable regulations , such as 27.@@ 9@@ 39 , 29.@@ 9@@ 39 , 27.@@ 10@@ 91 , and 29.@@ 10@@ 91 , for safe installation and operation .
the engine installation instructions typically require the measurement of certain parameters ( static pressure , dynamic pressure , total temperature , etc . ) at specific locations that cor@@ re@@ late to the engine manufacturer limits for maintaining the engine airworthiness .
an adequate evaluation of inlet distortion should be performed to ensure safe engine operation throughout the operating envelope : 1 ) with varying levels of filter blockage including possible asymmetric contamination that may occur as one side of the ibf becomes dirty with the alternate air source closed ; 
2 ) in the alternate air source open condition with the filter at the impending blockage level ; 
and 3 ) at each engine location for multi-@@ engine aircraft installations or at the most critical location for inlet distortion if this location is substanti@@ ated .
the types of equipment in this class include HF radios , high-@@ powered ra@@ d@@ ars , hoists , high-@@ powered radios , installations where radio transmission antennas are in close proximity to the controls , and equipment that require large curren@@ ts to operate or radi@@ ate strong electromagnetic fi@@ elds .
examples of this type of equipment are some Emergency Medical Service ( E@@ MS ) equipment , night sun lights , some air condi@@ tion@@ ers , video and sound systems that require large curren@@ ts ( 25 A@@ mps - up ) to operate , Forward Loo@@ king Inf@@ rared System ( FL@@ IRS ) , some forward looking ra@@ d@@ ars , some weather ra@@ d@@ ars , some communication systems that transmit 30 W@@ AT@@ TS or more , some data link transmission systems , etc .
for these 2 hoist po@@ pu@@ lations , it is proposed to demon@@ st@@ rate compliance with above listed requirements on an ES@@ F basis established with the following compensating factors , as derived from the investig@@ ation for the EAS@@ A AD .
Class of Equipment - Equipment Not known to Ha@@ ve a High potential for Interference : once it has been established that the equipment being proposed to be installed is not in the class of equipment known to have a high potential for interference , per the criteria sta@@ ted in paragraph 5 , there is no requirement to conduct the EMI installation tests described in the EMI Installation Testing for Critical Controls / Installation Test Conditions paragraphs 7 and 8 .
the engine ibf installation must be shown to comply with § § 27.@@ 10@@ 93 or 29.@@ 10@@ 93 , including ( b ) ( 1 ) ( i ) and ( II ) , regardless of whether the applicant is se@@ e@@ king approval for flight into known icing , in which case § § 27.@@ 14@@ 19 or 29.@@ 14@@ 19 would also apply .
the effects of ice and snow on the ibf system and the possible resulting hazards to the aircraft must also be evaluated with the alternate air source closed , open , and in transition , as specified in the approved RFM operating limitations .
it must be shown , for example , that each engine with an ibf installation will not preclude the Ro@@ tor@@ craft from achie@@ ving ibf flight manual performance throughout the approved operating envelope of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
icing conditions : compliance with the induction system icing protection rules ( § § 27.@@ 10@@ 93 and 29.@@ 10@@ 93 ) is required regardless of flight manual limitations or restrictions against flight into icing conditions .
appropriate operational limitations ai@@ ming at reducing the accelerations on the cable ( e.g. max bank angle of 20 ° with a HE@@ C load attached ) shall be intro@@ duced in the RFM together with appropriate CAUTION and WARNING notes to manage abnormal be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our .
however , EMI installation testing is the only method of testing to show compliance for interference considerations , for the class of equipment known to have a high potential for interference . the criteria for determining whether the equipment is known to have a high potential for interference is sta@@ ted in paragraph 5 .
a new Airworthiness Limitation ( A@@ WL ) Airworthiness Limitation Instruction ( ALI ) will require periodic replacement of the main tank fu@@ el@@ ling float switch assemblies and the cen@@ tr@@ e tank float switch and liner system .
for aircraft se@@ e@@ king certification for flight into icing conditions in accordance with § § 27.@@ 14@@ 19 or 29.@@ 14@@ 19 , the ibf system , including alternate air source operation , must be evaluated throughout the approved icing envelope .
for hoist critical parts other than the overload clutch , it shall be demonstrated through an analysis of their service history that during their in-service use they have not been the cause of any unsafe condition .
a change to make the design compli@@ ant could require a system change to reduce the voltage and current to in@@ tr@@ in@@ sically safe levels or a change to the refuel system that elimin@@ ates the use of a float switch .
as a result of such design solution , the audio signal recorded on the second channel of the CVR contains , in addition to the audio signal received from second pilot station , the audio signal received from the 3@@ r@@ d crew member .
falling and blowing snow ( F &amp; BS ) : the falling and blowing snow regulations for the engine induction system , § § 27.@@ 10@@ 93 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( II ) or 29.@@ 10@@ 93 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( II ) , require a showing that the system can operate throughout the flight power range of the engine in F &amp; BS within the limitations established for the Ro@@ tor@@ craft . AC 27@@ -1 or AC 29@@ -2 provide guidance for three different approaches to establi@@ shing appropriate limitations :
to accomplish the EMI installation tests , there must be an FA@@ A-@@ approved test plan that requires the high interference potential equipment to be operated through all reasonable modes of operation in order to determine if electromagnetic interference is entering the electronic control system .
a Hoist Critical Parts Quality Management Plan will be deployed defin@@ ing the actions under@@ taken for the control of key characteristics on hoist critical parts drawings , the management of manufacturing processes of sub-@@ ti@@ ers suppliers , the inspection requirements to be carried out in production to guarantee the production surveillance of parts .
a demon@@ stration of the ability to subsequently separate the second pilot voice recording and 3@@ r@@ d crew member voice recording shall be demonstrated as an Equivalent Level of Safety for EAS@@ A acceptance .
for inadvertent or full F &amp; BS conditions , an evaluation of the ibf installation must show that the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter will achieve ibf flight manual performance in all alternate air source configurations approved for use in F &amp; BS .
other considerations : another ibf installation consideration includes evaluation of frozen precipitation that melts and ref@@ re@@ e@@ z@@ es on the downstream ( aft ) side of the ibf to ensure that the quantity of ice that accumula@@ tes and sh@@ ed@@ s will not adversely affect safe engine operation .
although this is still considered an un@@ restricted icing clearance and no operational restrictions are applied , Appendix C does not cover the full range of conditions likely to be encountered and certain limitations are necessary e.g. flight in mixed conditions or freezing rain / dri@@ zz@@ le is prohibited .
the here@@ by presented Equivalent safety Fin@@ ding ( ES@@ F ) has been classified as an important ES@@ F and as such shall be subject to public consultation , in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board Decision 2 / 200@@ 7 , dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 . ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 ) states :
Deviations from the applicable airworthiness codes , environmental protection certification specifications and / or acceptable means of compliance with Part 21 , as well as important special conditions and equivalent safety findings , shall be submitted to the panel of ex@@ per@@ ts and be subject to a public consultation of at least 3 weeks , except if they have been previously agreed and published in the Off@@ ic@@ ial Publication of the A@@ gency .
in defin@@ ing the extended flight envelope , the applicant is pro@@ po@@ sing a V@@ N@@ E reduction curve above the already certified ceiling that do@@ es@@ n &@@ a@@ po@@ s@@ ;@@ t meet the criteria of CS 29.@@ 15@@ 05 ( c ) ( 2 ) for power@@ -off condition , which require to be defined as
an analysis in accordance with § § 27.@@ 1309 , 29.@@ 1309 , 27.@@ 13@@ 51 , 29.@@ 13@@ 51 , Appendix B to parts 27 and 29 , and Appendix C to part 27 may require the alternate air source to be powered following the loss of the normal electrical power generating system .
it must also be shown that the activation and operation of the alternate air source meets the inlet distortion requirements in all alternate air source configurations ( open , closed , and in transition ) .
ground tests alone are usually not sufficient since some equipment may po@@ se safety issues if operated on the ground , while other equipment cannot be satisfactorily operated on the ground , or the equipment would provide mis@@ leading results if operated on the ground .
the intent of the requirement for definition of the V@@ N@@ E power@@ -off is to provide the crew with a means to easily remember or to un@@ mista@@ k@@ ea@@ bly determine the V@@ N@@ E power@@ -off in any possible flight condition with a minimum mental ef@@ for@@ t .
two different coun@@ ters have been implemented for this feature : the E@@ ECU ( Electronic Engine Control Unit ) counter , based on which automatic engine power reduction is activated , and the CD@@ S counter , whose time coun@@ t-@@ down is displayed on both the MFD and the Power Index ( PI ) of the PFD , in order to give indication to the pilot of the time remaining until expi@@ ration of the 30 second and 2@@ ,@@ 5min O@@ E@@ I M@@ GB ratings .
in fact , the engine E@@ ECU counter is designed so that , once the 30 second O@@ E@@ I M@@ GB rating is entered , it completes the 30 seconds coun@@ t-@@ down cycle regardless of the actual duration of the ex@@ cur@@ sion sp@@ end into the 30 second power rating .
if the proposed installed equipment has been tested in relation to the critical electronic control system on another identical installation , then there can be an exception to the EMI installation testing requirements defined in paragraph 7 and 8 .
in this case , the automatic engine power reduction may occur without any relevant cue displayed to the flight crew as the CD@@ S counter will still continue to display some remaining time available for the 30 second power rating .
the 30 second power rating is ex@@ ited before completion of a full 30 seconds time and the pilot would need torque increase to re-@@ enter into the 30 second power rating after the automatic power reduction has occurred .
the In@@ corpo@@ ration and utilization of an alternate air source must ensure that engine operation is guaran@@ te@@ ed to provide no less than the power required to meet the ibf flight manual performance and engine installation manual requirements , which includes ibf installation losses , throughout the operating envelope of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
since no cues are given to the pilot of the automatic engine power reduction activation , when he wants to enter the 30 second power rating again , the T@@ Q is to@@ pped at 155 % , and therefore he will experience an NR dro@@ op .
in fact , the avionics system automatically computes and displays , for any combination of pressure altitude and temperature within the certified flight envelope , the V@@ N@@ E value on the airspeed indicator of the Primary Flight Display ( PFD ) , by means of a red line in case of power-on or a red cross-@@ hatched line in case of O@@ E@@ I or power@@ -off .
this policy sta@@ tement provides acceptable methods for demon@@ stra@@ ting compliance with certain fl@@ am@@ ma@@ bility requirements of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations ( 14 C@@ FR ) 23.@@ 8@@ 53 , 23.@@ 8@@ 55 , 23.@@ 13@@ 59 , 25.@@ 8@@ 53 , 25.@@ 8@@ 55 , 25.@@ 17@@ 13 , 27.@@ 8@@ 53 , 27.@@ 8@@ 55 , 27.@@ 13@@ 65 , 29.@@ 8@@ 53 , 29.@@ 8@@ 55 , and 29.@@ 13@@ 59 .
this includes compliance with § § 27.@@ 603 and 29.@@ 603 , which can be demonstrated by showing the su@@ it@@ ability and durability of ibf assembly materials in normal and emergency operating conditions , such as high ibf differential pressure .

in case of full use of the 30 second power rating ( synchron@@ is@@ ed condition ) , flashing of the last 10 seconds of the CD@@ S 30s coun@@ ters display provides adequate cues to the pilot that the automatic engine power reduction is triggered .
Sim@@ il@@ arly , if the alternate air source is not in the correct configuration that was either commanded by the pilot or automatically activated by the ibf system , a cockpit annunciation may be a means to alert the crew and comply with § § 27.@@ 1309 or 29.@@ 1309 .

it should be noted that , for this policy , as in paragraph 2-@@ 6@@ k ( 2 ) of Order 8@@ 11@@ 0.4 , FAA use of technical data does not permit applic@@ ants or de@@ sig@@ ne@@ es who may be working for a subsequent applicant to request access to a TC holder data without the TC holder permission .
an alternative recording method , which demon@@ strates that the original intent of FA@@ R 29.@@ 14@@ 57 ( a ) ( 4 ) and FA@@ R / CS 29.@@ 14@@ 57 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) is met , should be provided for EAS@@ A acceptance containing elements like :
design values may be used to show compliance to § § 2@@ x@@ .@@ 613 , § § 33.@@ 15 and 35.@@ 17 on new certification pro@@ jec@@ ts as long as it can be shown that the values , along with associated analy@@ tical methods ( see AC 20-@@ 10@@ 7B ) , are applicable to the new pro@@ ject .
for designs where the O@@ E@@ I airflow required for category A performance may not be achie@@ vable through an ibf at the impending blockage level , the applicant may elec@@ t to activate the alternate air source prior to executing a category A procedure to ensure ibf flight manual performance .
the FAA is limiting this method to applications where trac@@ eability is made to a type certificate ( TC ) or am@@ ended type certificate ( ATC ) to limit risk of non-@@ compliance due to increasing separation from the original substantiation data .
automatic operation of the alternate air source following an engine failure is an acceptable method to provide the required engine airflow for maximum O@@ E@@ I con@@ t@@ ing@@ en@@ cy power while comp@@ lying with the above two regulatory requirements .
alternatively , the applicant may either require the alternate air source be activated prior to initiating the category A procedure , if the appropriate engine power can be generated , or may prohibit category A operations with an ibf installed .
the appendix to this policy me@@ m@@ o outlines guidance and cl@@ ar@@ ification on the technical information and document processes that a component contractor would need to provide to an applicant to enable the applicant to use that component contractor developed composite design values during compliance showing of the applicant new certification pro@@ ject .
accordingly , to allow the flight crew to determine the take-off and bal@@ ked landing paths and guarantee obstacle clearance , paragraph CS 29.@@ 15@@ 87 ( a ) ( 6 ) requires the publication of the first and second segment climb gra@@ di@@ ents determined in accordance with the conditions described above in the performance section of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft Flight Manual ( RFM ) .
they allow the Ro@@ tor@@ craft to climb longer at a speed of V@@ TO@@ SS with 2@@ min O@@ E@@ I power applied than it would be possible with a conventional procedure where the acceleration to a speed of V@@ Y is carried out at a height of 200 ft ( or at the height selected by the applicant in case of a bal@@ ked landing ) to continue the climb with M@@ CP O@@ E@@ I .
B ) To f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l CS 29.@@ 59 ( d ) , for the alternative procedures the rate of climb between a height of 200 ft and 1000 ft ATS is not less than the rate of climb required by CS 29.@@ 67 ( a ) ( 2 ) . 
Con@@ sequ@@ ently , when part of the climb between a height of 200 ft and 1000 ft is performed at a speed of V@@ TO@@ SS with O@@ E@@ I 2@@ min power , the steady rate of climb must be at least 150 ft / min . 
to assure a continuous climb , this minimum Ro@@ C must be maintained in the entire first segment . 
therefore , the alternative procedures are only applicable for those Category A procedures for which the first segment Ro@@ C is not the limiting parameter in deter@@ ming the take-off or landing weight and a minimum of 150@@ fpm is always achie@@ vable in the first climb segment .
this is acceptable provided the ar@@ ticle is being installed in the same manner and orientation as the ar@@ ticle previously approved , and the data previously generated during the original type certification is appropriate for showing compliance to the applicable requirements .
1.@@ 1.3 The applicant can seek approval for installation of additional quantities of identical parts ─ i.e. , parts with the same part number or opposite part number ( right hand , left hand ) , that are already installed on a product without fl@@ am@@ ma@@ bility substantiation data provided : ( 1 ) the parts being installed were previously approved ;
for this me@@ m@@ or@@ and@@ um , the production process included all phases of the manufacture ( i.e. , methods of assembling consistent materials , quality assurance methods , curing methods , post curing machining , etc . ) that needs to be controlled in order to con@@ struct consistently sound structure .
this method is dependent on the applicant ability to show that the approved design holder parts comp@@ lied with the appropriate fl@@ am@@ ma@@ bility requirements for the product on which they were installed , and that the applicable aspec@@ ts of the material , design , use , orientation , and certification basis align between the holder and applicant articles .
whenever a proposed method of compliance devi@@ ates from the guidance in this policy sta@@ tement , the pro@@ ject aircraft certification office coordinates it with the policy iss@@ u@@ ing office using an issue paper .
Sim@@ il@@ arly , if the pro@@ ject aircraft certification office becomes aware of reasons that an applicant pro@@ po@@ sal that meets this policy should not be approved , the office coordinates its response with the policy iss@@ u@@ ing office .
many applic@@ ants se@@ e@@ king a type certificate ( TC ) or supplemental type certificate ( ST@@ C ) are using component contractors to not only produce parts for their product , but to also assume more of the design responsibility in de@@ sig@@ ning those parts .
in order to help alle@@ vi@@ ate the fin@@ an@@ c@@ ial bur@@ den this places on component contractors , they have so@@ u@@ g@@ ht a means to gain FAA approval of composite design values independent of any specific certification pro@@ ject .
it is also FAA policy to allow the use of data previously used to show compliance with the regulations on past certification pro@@ jec@@ ts to support certification of new products that use the same material and process specifications .
existing design values may be used to show compliance to § § 2@@ x@@ .@@ 613 , § § 33.@@ 15 and 35.@@ 17 on new certification pro@@ jec@@ ts as long as the applicant can show that the values , along with associated analy@@ tical methods , are applicable to the new pro@@ ject .
Ad@@ FC systems , on the other hand , typically feature electronic signal processing and signal transmission using electrical wires , such as fly-by-wire , optical fibers ( fl@@ y-@@ by@@ - light ) , or po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally even non@@ - mechanical media ( radio frequency control ) .
while showing the applicability of design values is the responsibility of the applicant , Appendix A provides guidance on the type of information a component supplier should provide to the applicant to show applicability .

since Ad@@ FC systems typically emp@@ lo@@ y a high level of integration and increased functionality relative to conventional systems , a greater possibility exists for development errors that are not as obvious or te@@ stable as those for conventional flight control systems .
Principal Structural Element ( PSE ) ( AC 25.@@ 57@@ 1-@@ 1D ) : an element that contributes significantly to the carrying of flight , ground , or pressurization loads , and whose integrity is essential in maintaining the overall structural integrity of the airplane .

in other words , if the ST@@ C or AST@@ C applicant shows sufficient evidence of trac@@ eability to previously FA@@ A-@@ approved compliance data , the responsibility for sub@@ mission of necessary data has been satisfied .
Sim@@ il@@ arly , if the implementing office becomes aware of reasons that an applicant pro@@ po@@ sal that meets this policy should not be approved , the office must coordinate its response with the pol@@ ic@@ y-@@ iss@@ u@@ ing office .

because the FAA already has ( or has access to ) the compliance data associated with the ar@@ ticle , the applicant may meet this requirement by providing evidence of the previous FAA approval through the compara@@ tive analysis / trac@@ eability method as described above .
differences in the certification basis may exist due to the am@@ en@@ d@@ ment level of an airworthiness requirement , a g@@ r@@ ant of ex@@ e@@ mption , an equivalent level of safety finding , or a difference in a special condition .

the Design Ass@@ urance Level ( D@@ AL ) for an F@@ D@@ MS that is required by an operating regulation is D@@ AL D. RT@@ CA DO-178B ( or later revision ) provides acceptable software development standards , which in this case would be for D@@ AL D software .

whenever a proposed method of compliance devi@@ ates from the guidance in this policy sta@@ tement , the pro@@ ject aircraft certification office ( AC@@ O ) coordinates with the policy iss@@ u@@ ing office , the Ro@@ tor@@ craft Direc@@ to@@ rate Standards STA@@ FF ( AS@@ W@@ -@@ 110 ) , using an issue paper .
the Ro@@ tor@@ craft F@@ D@@ MS section of M@@ G-@@ 6 of both 27-@@ IB and AC 29-@@ 2C lists compliance finding methods that may apply to type certificate , am@@ ended type certificate , supplemental type certificate , and am@@ ended supplemental type certification programs or field approval .
when review ing a proposed certification basis for an F@@ D@@ MS program , the pro@@ ject AC@@ O or F@@ SD@@ O should ensure that the means of compliance proposed by the applicant would allow at least for a compliance finding in accordance w &@@ a@@ po@@ s@@ ;@@ it@@ h the requirements of this policy sta@@ tement .
typically , the maintenance related rules would include the general requirements that may apply to various aircraft types and operations , and any additional requirements that may be dee@@ med specific to operating provisions .
Sim@@ il@@ arly , polyurethane foam was installed exten@@ si@@ vely on multiple aircraft products and used in applications such as environmental control systems and seals ( 20@@ 13-@@ 11-@@ 04 , 200@@ 8-@@ 02-@@ 16 , 20@@ 10-@@ 14-@@ 01 , 20@@ 12-@@ 02-@@ 09 , and 200@@ 1-@@ 26-@@ 09 ) .
for example , data used to show compliance for previously approved floor car@@ pe@@ ting that would be used on sidewalls or partitions would not be acceptable because the applicable environment ( orientation ) has been al@@ tered , and additional testing would be necessary .
if differences exist , the applicant may show compliance by providing proof of an existing FAA approval to address airworthiness requirements for those areas where no differences exist , but must also submit additional test reports and compu@@ tations necessary to show compliance for the differences .
approval of the request is dependent on the applicant pro@@ po@@ sal , overall comple@@ xity of determining compliance of the articles , and ability to se@@ gre@@ gate the previously approved ar@@ ticle compliance from other compliance sho@@ wings applicable to the original certification ef@@ for@@ t .
the applicant would still need to submit the design data , test reports , and compu@@ tations necessary to show compliance with the applicable airworthiness requirements not covered by the previous approval .

( B ) Indications on instruments in the primary field of view that are used during normal operations may be adequate if the indications themselves contain information used on a regular basis and are provided in a readily accessible form .
therefore , the signal processing or the analysis techniques utili@@ sed should reflec@@ t the comple@@ xity of the mechanical elements being monitored as well as the transmission path of the signal and should be demonstrated as being appropriate to the failure modes to be detected .

2.6 This policy sta@@ tement does not reli@@ eve applic@@ ants from their continued airworthiness responsibilities ( such as § 2@@ 1.3 , Reporting of failures , malfunctions and defects ; § 2@@ 1.50 , Instructions for continued airworthiness and manufacturers maintenance manuals having airworthiness limitations sections ; or § 2@@ 1.@@ 99 , Required design changes ) once the approval is issued .
drainage of fluids Subject to Freezing : if fluids subject to freezing may be drained overboard in flight or during ground operation , the drains must be designed and located to prevent the formation of hazardous quantities of ice on the Ro@@ tor@@ craft as a result of the drainage .
if the date of application prece@@ des the effective date of this policy and the methods of compliance have already been approved by the FAA , the applicant may choose to either follow the previously acceptable methods of compliance or follow the guidance contained in this policy .
if an applicant shows sufficient evidence of trac@@ eability to a previously FA@@ A-@@ approved TC holder type design and compliance data , the responsibility for sub@@ mission of the necessary data has been satisfied , and trac@@ eability to previously FA@@ A-@@ approved compliance data would be the docu@@ mented means of compliance as required by § 2@@ 1.20 ( a ) .
A@@ gency emp@@ loy@@ e@@ es and their de@@ sig@@ ne@@ es and de@@ le@@ ga@@ tions must not depart from this policy sta@@ tement without appropriate j@@ us@@ tification and con@@ curren@@ ce from the FAA office that issued this policy sta@@ tement .

as a result , an in-service bonded repair is more likely to have material property variation , which may Al@@ ter the basis for repair substantiation and may result in less than ultimate load capability in the repaired condition .

based on in@@ qui@@ ri@@ es regarding this policy and the associated guidance information in FAA Order 8@@ 11@@ 0.4 , this policy sta@@ tement provides additional cl@@ ar@@ ification regarding acceptable methods for sub@@ m@@ it@@ tal of fl@@ am@@ ma@@ bility compliance data and necessary documentation of compliance .
if the ST@@ C or AST@@ C applicant shows trac@@ eability to previously FA@@ A-@@ approved design and compliance data , the responsibility for sub@@ mission of some or all of the necessary data has been satisfied , and trac@@ eability to previously FA@@ A-@@ approved compliance data would be the docu@@ mented means of compliance as required by § 2@@ 1.20 ( a ) .
of the Assessment processes listed in AR@@ P@@ 47@@ 54A , the functional hazard Assessment ( FHA ) , preliminary system safety Assessment ( PS@@ SA ) , common cause analysis ( CC@@ A ) , and the system safety Assessment ( S@@ SA ) should be utilized , at a minimum .
sections 2@@ x@@ .@@ 603 , 2@@ x@@ .@@ 605 , and 2@@ x@@ .@@ 613 , 33.@@ 15 and 35.@@ 17 , re@@ late to the control of structural properties of composite materials through defined material specifications and process specifications along with the development of associated design values .
the Original Equipment Manufacturer ( O@@ EM ) Structural Repair Manual ( SRM ) typically limits bonded repair size , often as a function of part location , based on their internal databases and access to field experi@@ ences .
other aircraft types , such as small airplanes , transport airplanes , gli@@ ders , and balloons , should not be included on Ro@@ tor@@ craft AM@@ L ST@@ Cs , because of po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally significant differences in airworthiness standards and policies .
once composite design values have been approved through a certification pro@@ ject , they may be used on other certification pro@@ jec@@ ts as long as it is demonstrated that they are being properly maintained and are applicable to the new pro@@ ject .
this has been done to dis@@ cou@@ rage the pre@@ mi@@ se that structural substantiation has been achieved for the rever@@ se@@ d@@ - engin@@ ee@@ red design or that a safe product will result , unless additional structural data is generated to address considerations docu@@ mented in this policy .
the AM@@ L ST@@ C certification basis should not include a combination of Civil Air Regulation ( car ) part 6 , 14 C@@ FR part 27 , car part 7 or 14 C@@ FR part 29 Ro@@ tor@@ craft ( for example , one AM@@ L ST@@ C might include car 6 Ro@@ tor@@ craft , while another AM@@ L ST@@ C might include part 27 Ro@@ tor@@ craft , and y@@ et another might include part 29 Ro@@ tor@@ craft ) .
differences between these regulations may be significant , and even in in@@ stances where the regulations are identical , the application of those regulations may be different depending on whether a specific model Ro@@ tor@@ craft is certified for instrument flight rules ( IFR ) operation or Category A operation .
this appendix identifies a method to verify that composite design values and process specifications used in a previous certification pro@@ ject are acceptable for use on other products based on proper development and control .
defin@@ ing the certification basis for Ro@@ tor@@ craft certified under different rules , even when they are included on the same T@@ CD@@ S , will require added di@@ l@@ ig@@ ence to ensure that all applicable rules are included in the certification basis .
App@@ lic@@ ants who plan to use component con@@ trac@@ tor@@ -@@ designed composite components as part of their type design are responsible for sub@@ mitting substanti@@ ating data that shows the applicability of composite design values , process specifications and analy@@ tical methods used to design components for their pro@@ ject .
the expected approach , when comb@@ ining Ro@@ tor@@ craft certified under different regulatory rules on an AM@@ L ST@@ C , would be to have all models on that AM@@ L ST@@ C meet the highest certification standards of any model on that AM@@ L ST@@ C .
also , composite design values previously used for a specific pro@@ ject may be used to show compliance for other products as long as the applicant can demon@@ st@@ rate the applicability of those design values and the analy@@ tical techniques used to design the component used in the product .
App@@ lic@@ ants in this type of arrangement with component contractors must also be aware that regardless of the source of any design value , the applic@@ ants applying for the certification of a product re@@ tains final responsibility for any and all composite design values used to design and certify their product .
the applicant may use existing composite design values from past certification pro@@ jec@@ ts for new pro@@ jec@@ ts as long as the applicant can demon@@ st@@ rate that the composite design values are applicable to the new pro@@ ject and that proper process controls are in place .
this policy infor@@ ms Aircraft Certification office ( AC@@ O ) engine@@ ers and de@@ sig@@ ne@@ es that due to inspection limitations , bonded repair must be further limited to a maximum size whe@@ re@@ by limit load residual strength can be demonstrated with a complete or partial failure of the bond within the repair or base structure ar@@ re@@ sting design features .
as one example of the proof of structure , both damage tolerance and residual strength data would be needed to expand the size limits for a given bonded repair to substanti@@ ate structural capability of the larger repair with impact damage and to ensure limit load capability still exists with a failed repair .
have sufficient knowledge of the component contractor procedures used in developing and maintaining composite design values so that any qu@@ es@@ tions the FAA might ask about the final composite design values used can be add@@ ressed .
the first section could list all the applicable § 2@@ 1.@@ 101 regulations in the installation that will be b@@ rought up to the latest am@@ en@@ d@@ ment level and the second section could list all the models with their T@@ CD@@ S and original certification basis .
following the points above , applic@@ ants may use composite design values developed by component contractors specific to their material and manufacturing processes as part of the applicant certification pro@@ ject ( i.e. , TC or ST@@ C ) .
2.@@ 2.@@ 2.4 Oscil@@ la@@ tory is a type of failure caused by one of a number of effects : system in@@ stability due to a cor@@ rup@@ ted sensor signal ( e.g. , angular rate ) , excitation from a cor@@ rup@@ ted hardware component ( e.g. , operational amplifier ) , or excitation of res@@ on@@ ance frequencies ( e.g. , air res@@ on@@ ance , structural res@@ on@@ ance of tail rotor shaft ) .
in the case where applic@@ ants wi@@ sh to use existing composite design values developed by a component contractor , they must have access to that data which details how the design values were derived and maintained along with their intended use .
in order for applic@@ ants to use the component contractor composite design values developed for past certification pro@@ jec@@ ts , applic@@ ants need to obtain the following information from the component contractor :
this definition was adopted because there are differences in the definitions of primary structure , secondary structure , and principal structural elements ( PSE ) when considering the different categories of aircraft ( taken from Advisory Circular ( AC ) 20-@@ 10@@ 7B ) .
the ability of the crew , particularly for single pilot operations , to follow the flight manual procedures should be determined given that the flight characteristics could be degraded and should not require excessive workload or skill .
these procedures are part of the information needed to show that the composite design values are applicable to the new design , including sufficient details so new applic@@ ants can assess whether the composite design values and associated analy@@ tical methods proposed by the component contractor are applicable to their product and comply with the regulations .
details on the composite material properties for which design values were derived and the range of operational environmental conditions for which the design values are valid ( e.g. , temperature , moisture , etc . ) .
the internal docu@@ mented processes that were followed to der@@ ive composite design values , which comply with the sta@@ tis@@ tical requirements outlined in the appropriate regulations ( § § 2@@ x@@ .@@ 603 , 2@@ x@@ .@@ 605 , 2@@ x@@ .@@ 613 along with § § 33.@@ 15 and § § 35.@@ 17 ) .
depending upon the results of the model specific system safety Assessment ( S@@ SA ) of the product , it may be necessary to address parts 27 or 29 high intensity Radiated field ( H@@ IR@@ E ) and electromagnetic interference ( EMI ) requirements for each individual model being included on the AM@@ L ST@@ C .
as most component contractors seek to 3 provide the same part for several different applic@@ ants , they find that they are often required to repeat the tests and analysis used to der@@ ive design values for the same materials and process specifications for each individual applicant .
design values derived by component suppliers and previously approved for showing compliance on a certified product may be used for showing compliance to another applicant product as long as the applicant can show applicability to the product .
this policy sta@@ tement provides direction to Direc@@ to@@ rates on the requirement and imple@@ mentation of the special conditions for installation of re@@ chargeable lithium batteries and battery systems on Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations ( 14 C@@ FR ) parts 23 , 25 , 27 , and 29 aircraft .
( 2 ) FADEC , air data attitude heading reference systems ( AD@@ AHRS ) , or electronic flight instrument system ( EFIS ) equipped Ro@@ tor@@ craft may also require special provisions for identifying acceptable antenna and added equipment installation locations .
if the equipment being installed by the AM@@ L ST@@ C is connected or coupled to required systems and its failure or malfunction could create hazardous or catastrophic conditions , integration evaluation and a safety analysis are necessary for each Ro@@ tor@@ craft model and configuration .
the continued advan@@ cement of bonding in small airplane and Ro@@ tor@@ craft structures and recent imple@@ mentation of bonding as a principal means of fa@@ br@@ ic@@ ating critical structures on transport airplanes ( e.g. , pressure h@@ ul@@ l and wing box structure ) increases the li@@ k@@ eli@@ hood of bonding as a vi@@ able repair option .
take special care to describe internal procedures for controlling changes made to specifications after their approval to ensure that associated design values and approved designs are not affected ( e.g. , when a resin form@@ ulation is changed because the source of the ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents has changed or when the location of a manufacturing facility has changed ) .
however , the AM@@ L ST@@ C applicant will need to assess the DO-@@ 160 environmental qualification levels ( for example , vibration , temperature , altitude , EMI radiation ) against the actual installation environment for each of the listed AM@@ L Ro@@ tor@@ craft models because there may be significant variations from one model Ro@@ tor@@ craft to another .
2.@@ 3.@@ 1.2 Wh@@ ere one channel is active while the other channels are on standby , the affected control channel should be deactivated and replaced with one of the standby channels , which then provides the required functionality .
the composite design values generated by a component contractor are considered applicable to that component contractor design and production processes and are only valid for that component contractor internal use only .
for example , connecting a non@@ essential system to an essential power bus could create a potential safety hazard if the non@@ essential system failed and disabled the essential power bus or the installation of an antenna near a FADEC may cause interference with the FADEC critical functions .
an applicant may use the guidance in this appendix to use design values generated by a component contractor , but this guidance does not author@@ ize use of the design values independent from the component contractor design and production processes .
2.@@ 3.3 Continuous monitoring sche@@ mes , such as voltage comparators , input data monitoring ( val@@ idity , par@@ ity , update , and range ) , memory checks , and w@@ atch@@ do@@ g timer should be performed to detect potential equipment failures and system malfunctions , such as signal run@@ a@@ ways and oscil@@ la@@ tory failures .
special Condition Requirement # 1 : safe cell temperatures and pressures must be maintained during all fore@@ se@@ eable charging or discharging condition and during any failure of the charging or battery monitoring system not shown to be extremely remote .

the cells within the re@@ chargeable lithium battery system shall be designed to minimize the impact of self-@@ su@@ sta@@ ined , un@@ controlled increases in cell temperature or pressure , which may result from all fore@@ se@@ eable charging or discharging condition .
common processing errors such as high humidity , improper surface preparation , bondline contamination , insufficient control of cure temperature ( either overheating or under@@ -@@ cure ) , loss of vacuum or pressure , and use of materials outside of time and temperature or calendar life limits can cause un@@ detectable low bondline st@@ rengths .
a possible increased safety risk from failed or mal@@ functioning non-@@ required equipment to an individual Ro@@ tor@@ craft operating in unusual conditions should not nec@@ ess@@ arily over@@ sha@@ do@@ w the rest of the fleet benef@@ iting from the safety En@@ han@@ cement resulting from the introduction of such equipment in most operational conditions .
if the configuration of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft being modified is different from the model tested for the AM@@ L ST@@ C , the responsibility for showing compa@@ tibility with these differences will fall on the in@@ stal@@ ler because the AM@@ L ST@@ C will not author@@ ize the installation on this un@@ tested configuration .
introduc@@ ing new or changing existing cockpit procedures or configurations to a previously approved IFR or Category A Ro@@ tor@@ craft will require an Assessment and possible flight evaluation before approval .
special Condition Requirement # 3 : no explosive or toxic gases e@@ m@@ it@@ ted by any re@@ chargeable lithium battery in normal operation , or as the result of a failure of the battery charging system , monitoring system , or battery installation which is not shown to be extremely remote , may accumula@@ te in hazardous quantities within the aircraft .
however , since NOR@@ SEE equipment is not required , the safety Assessment should determine that any known loss of function of the equipment would not present a hazard higher than minor to the Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
the substanti@@ ating data that supports proof of structure for the bonded repair must include the tests or analy@@ ses supported by tests that meet the applicable regulatory requirements for fatigue and damage tolerance , static and dynamic strength , material and fa@@ br@@ ications specification , sta@@ tis@@ tical material allo@@ wa@@ bles , flutter be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or , and lightning protection .
2.@@ 3.6 Ad@@ FC systems typically emp@@ lo@@ y reset features to re@@ engage comp@@ ro@@ mi@@ sed parts of the Ad@@ FC system after failures ( i.e. , to re@@ engage one or more of several control paths that have been disengaged following a monitor trip ) for situations where the condition that caused the monitor trip remains invalid .

an example would be ensuring that non@@ required equipment is not connected to an electrical bus that supplies power to systems required for continued safe flight and landing ( for example , emergency and essential buses ) .
connecting non@@ required or non@@ essential equipment to an essential or critical level bus , without a dedicated means to remove power to all the non@@ required equipment , may inhibit the ability of the crew to quickly remove power from this equipment during an emergency .

the AM@@ L ST@@ C applicant should be aware that adding a model with a different certification basis ( that is , visual flight rules ( VFR ) versus instrument flight rules ( IFR ) or Category B versus Category A ) may require additional equipment , design analysis , and flight tests .
3.@@ 1.1 There is a possibility that an operation of an Ad@@ FC system , either directly or because of a failure , could affect the Ro@@ tor@@ craft structural capabilities or aero@@ elastic stability , both in the normal and in the failed state .
no corrosive fluids or gases that may escape from any re@@ chargeable lithium battery may damage surrounding structure or any adjacent systems , equipment , or electrical wiring of the aircraft in such a way as to cause a major or more severe failure condition , in accordance with § 23.@@ 1309 ( c ) and applicable regulatory guidance .
in addition , the applicant must be aware of all special conditions for each Ro@@ tor@@ craft model having systems performing critical functions and consider the impact that the introduction of their proposed system may have on these existing systems .
these AC@@ s recognize the Safety Assessment process reflected in SAE AR@@ P 47@@ 61 ( Guidelines and Methods for conducting the Safety Assessment Process on Civil Airborne Systems and Equipment ) and SAE AR@@ P 47@@ 54 ( Certification considerations for highly Integrated or Comp@@ lex Aircraft Systems ) documents .
instructions for Continued Airworthiness ( ICA@@ s ) must be accepted , in accordance with FAA Order 8@@ 11@@ 0.@@ 54 , by the F@@ ort Wor@@ th Aircraft Evaluation Group ( F@@ TW@@ -@@ A@@ E@@ G ) and the Airworthiness Limitation Section ( ALS ) must be approved by the FAA , for each model listed on the AM@@ L ST@@ C .

no corrosive fluids or gases that may escape from any re@@ chargeable lithium battery may damage surrounding structure or any adjacent systems , equipment , or electrical wiring of the aircraft in such a way as to cause a major or more severe failure condition , in accordance with § § 27.@@ 1309 ( b ) and ( c ) , and applicable regulatory guidance .
no corrosive fluids or gases that may escape from any re@@ chargeable lithium battery may damage surrounding structure or any adjacent systems , equipment , or electrical wiring of the aircraft in such a way as to cause a major or more severe failure condition , in accordance with § 29.@@ 1309 ( b ) and all other applicable regulatory guidance .
special Condition Requirement # 6 : each re@@ chargeable lithium battery installation must have provisions to prevent any hazardous effect on structure or essential systems caused by the maximum amount of heat the battery can generate during a short circuit of the battery or of its individual cells .
these tools help determine the necessary availability , reliability , and integrity of the systems and equipment being installed based on the ass@@ essed hazards to the aircraft resulting from a system or equipment malfunction .
the re@@ chargeable lithium battery system shall be designed to minimize the impact of sel@@ f@@ - su@@ sta@@ ined , un@@ controlled increases in temperature or pressure , as a result of cell failures ( e.g. , internal cell short circuit ) or a short circuit of the battery .
some of the key certification considerations are system redundancy , isolation , software and airborne electronic hardware D@@ AL@@ s , minimum operational performance standards , as well as any mi@@ tig@@ ating features incorporated to meet the established D@@ AL for the system under consideration .
the bonded repair must be shown to be capable of with@@ standing ultimate static loads and be shown to retain the required residual strength , as defined in the applicable 14 C@@ FR parts ( i.e. , 2@@ x@@ .@@ 571 / 57@@ 3 ) .
( I ) A battery temperature sensing and over-@@ temperature warning system with a means for automatically disconnecting the battery from its charging source in the event of an over@@ - temperature condition , or
use this policy and existing guidance material ( including , but not limited to AR@@ P 47@@ 54 , AC 27@@ -1 , AC 29@@ -2 , and RT@@ CA / DO-@@ 313 ) for certification of NOR@@ SEE on Ro@@ tor@@ craft certificated under parts 27 and 29 .
the intent of these criteria is to establish a means to ensure that the probability of exceeding a design limit load condition is no greater than for Ro@@ tor@@ craft with similar flight characteristics that do not include active control functions .
when an applicant shows and the FAA agrees that the NOR@@ SEE system under consideration provides an overall safety ben@@ e@@ fit for installation in the Ro@@ tor@@ craft model , a one level reduction in D@@ AL may be authorized .
special Condition Requirement # 8 : all re@@ chargeable lithium battery installation , the function of which is required for safe operation of the aircraft , must incorporate a monitoring and warning feature that will provide an indication to the appropriate flight crewmembers whenever the sta@@ te@@ - of-@@ charge of the batteries has fallen below levels considered acceptable for dispatch of the aircraft .
3.@@ 1.@@ 2.@@ 1.3 It should be demonstrated by analysis , sim@@ ulation , or testing that static structural strength satisfies limit load criteria for symmetrical and asymmetrical structural maneuvers specified in sub@@ part C , using the final configuration and control laws of the active load alle@@ vi@@ ation functions .
any aircraft that uses a re@@ chargeable lithium battery or battery system whose function is necessary for safe operation shall require the In@@ corpo@@ ration of a monitoring and warning feature that will provide an accurate indication to the appropriate flight crewmembers whenever the sta@@ te-@@ of-@@ charge of the batteries has fallen below levels considered acceptable for dispatch of the aircraft .
for this process , the FAA uses an issue paper to document the determination of D@@ AL reduction author@@ ization ( s ) for those systems not already ass@@ essed , evaluated , and determined to meet the NOR@@ SEE criteria .
data supporting the bonded repair must include inspections that are capable of detecting complete or partial failure ( within ar@@ re@@ sting design features , e.g. , fasteners that exist within the base structure or repair design ) of the bond line .
3.@@ 1.@@ 2.@@ 3.1 evaluate failures of the system that result in su@@ sta@@ ined structural vibrations to ensure that the vibrations do not produce loads that could result in catastrophic failure , di@@ ver@@ gent dynamic effects , de@@ tri@@ mental deformation of primary structure , or hazardous effects on the flight crew or passengers .
the IC@@ A must also contain procedures for the maintenance of batteries in Spares storage to prevent the replacement of batteries with batteries that have experi@@ enced degraded charge retention ability or other damage due to prolonged storage at a low state of charge .
precautions should be included in the IC@@ A maintenance instructions to prevent mi@@ sh@@ and@@ ling of the re@@ chargeable lithium battery and re@@ chargeable lithium battery systems , which could result in shor@@ t-@@ circuit or other un@@ inten@@ tional impact damage caused by dropping or other destructive means that could result in personal injury or property damage .
inspection methods , th@@ resh@@ olds and intervals must be set considering the repeated load environment , li@@ k@@ eli@@ hood of load ex@@ cur@@ sions , the specific damage th@@ re@@ ats , cri@@ ticality of the structure and the magnitude of the residual strength in the case of a failed repair in accordance with AC 20-@@ 10@@ 7B ( i.e. , a failed repair which could result in a residual strength near limit load is recommended to be inspected with increased frequency ) .
a Ro@@ tor@@ craft free of PI@@ O ten@@ den@@ cies will avoid high frequency phase rol@@ l@@ -off , which is achie@@ vable by ma@@ xim@@ izing the attitude response frequency and minim@@ izing the gain at the 18@@ 0-@@ degree attitude phase la@@ g frequency .
Identification of system non@@ lin@@ ear@@ ities that can ab@@ rup@@ tly change control response characteristics and evalu@@ ating these conditions in flight during compensatory tra@@ cking tasks is an acceptable means of showing compliance .
bonded repairs to critical structures must be designed to be damage tolerant in order to preclude catastrophic failure due to fatigue , corrosion , or accidental damage throughout the operational life of the aircraft .
this policy sta@@ tement is intended to provide guidance to Aircraft Certification Off@@ ices ( AC@@ O ) regarding the application of special conditions to address Aircraft Systems Information Sec@@ urity Protection ( AS@@ IS@@ P ) vul@@ n@@ era@@ b@@ il@@ ities in aircraft certification programs .
in cases allowing this D@@ AL relief , there should be a way to readily identify this system and equipment as NOR@@ SEE , and there should be appropriate limitations on the installation approval ( e.g. , placards , Ro@@ tor@@ craft flight manual supplement , supplemental type certificate ( ST@@ C ) limitations ) .
manufacturing defects , which cannot be detected or which are on the threshold of de@@ te@@ c@@ tability with available inspection methods ( i.e. , porosity , disbonds and other an@@ om@@ al@@ ies ) must be controlled by process and included in the damage tolerance Assessment as appropriate .
recent designs for aircraft systems included connec@@ tivity to non-@@ tr@@ usted services such as the inter@@ net , portable electronic devices , and co@@ m@@ mer@@ ci@@ al-@@ off@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ shelf tech@@ no@@ log@@ ies not certified and acc@@ re@@ di@@ ted for secure operations by a government authority or other tr@@ usted service Provi@@ der .
these designs can intro@@ du@@ ce AS@@ IS@@ P vul@@ n@@ era@@ b@@ il@@ ities beyond the scope of current airworthiness regulations and traditional systems safety Assessment methods typically used to show compliance with the airworthiness requirements located in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations ( 14 C@@ FR ) § § 23.@@ 1301 , 25.@@ 1301 , 27.@@ 1301 , 29.@@ 1301 , 23.@@ 1309 , 25.1309 , 27.@@ 1309 , 29.@@ 1309 .
A@@ gency emp@@ loy@@ e@@ es , their de@@ sig@@ ne@@ es , and de@@ le@@ ga@@ tions must not depart from this policy sta@@ tement without appropriate j@@ us@@ tification and con@@ curren@@ ce from the FAA management that issued this policy sta@@ tement .
the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) will issue special conditions for initial type certificate ( TC ) , supplemental type certificate ( ST@@ C ) , am@@ ended TC , or am@@ ended ST@@ C applications for aircraft systems connecting to non-@@ tr@@ usted services ( e.g. , non-@@ g@@ overn@@ mental ) and ne@@ twor@@ ks :

if NOR@@ SEE software is installed in required equipment ( such as an integrated modu@@ lar avionics system ) and the D@@ AL of the required equipment is higher than the NOR@@ SEE D@@ AL , the software parti@@ tioning guidance in accordance with the latest FAA recognized version of RT@@ CA / DO-@@ 17@@ 8 should be followed .
all critical structure must have a repair size limit no larger than a size that allows limit load strength to be achieved with the repair failed or failed within constraints of the ar@@ re@@ sting design features ( in the repair or base structure ) .

Non-@@ tr@@ usted data transfer services without capability of transmitting to aircraft systems , e.g. , read only data services connected via receive only ARINC 429 bus , do not require iss@@ u@@ ance of special conditions .
under the conditions described below , an applicant may use data previously used to show compliance with the regulations on past certification pro@@ jec@@ ts in order to support certification of new products that use the same material and process specifications .
in order to assist component suppliers , some aircraft certification off@@ ices ( ACO@@ s ) have used special pro@@ jec@@ ts to allow the suppliers to gain access to the FAA re@@ sources required to demon@@ st@@ rate that design values they der@@ ive for their material and processes comply with the regulations even if they are directly connected to a specific certification pro@@ ject .
when re@@ viewing a proposed certification basis for an Ad@@ FC program , the pro@@ ject AC@@ O should ensure that the means of compliance proposed by the applicant would allow at least for a compliance finding in accordance with the requirements of this policy sta@@ tement .
if the date of application prece@@ des the effective date of the final policy , and the methods of compliance have already been coordinated with and approved by the FAA or its de@@ sig@@ ne@@ e , the applicant may choose to either follow the previously acceptable methods of compliance or follow the guidance contained in this policy .
this policy sta@@ tement does not require the iss@@ u@@ ance of special conditions for airworthiness and operational approval of field loadable software ( FL@@ S ) , aer@@ on@@ autical databases , and the Aircraft Communications Ad@@ dressing and Reporting System ( ACARS ) .
3.@@ 7.@@ 2.3 De@@ mon@@ st@@ rate that uncommanded su@@ sta@@ ined oscil@@ lations , the result of coupling between electronic or electrical command signals , and the motion of the mechanical actuator drive system together with the inter@@ facing structural components do not occur over the spectrum of operating frequencies .
this is to ensure that control margins ( at the rotor and the anti-@@ torque system level ) are sufficient in the defined flight conditions to avoid loss of control ( i.e. , that adequate control power exists to exit po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally hazardous flight conditions ) .
for example , Ad@@ FC systems incorpo@@ rating automatic trim follo@@ w-up eliminate the direct relationship between control in@@ ce@@ p@@ tor and cyclic or anti-@@ torque blade pitch , so the pilot does not have physical awareness of control remaining .
following this policy , the required system D@@ AL for non-@@ required systems that have been shown to increase overall Ro@@ tor@@ craft fleet safety , can be reduced by one more D@@ AL level than would be permissible without this policy .
some specific guidance on the engineering data and procedures , including the information needed for repairs that are not in compliance with the existing Design Appro@@ val Hol@@ ders Manu@@ als , appears in AC 43-@@ 214 .
any failed bonded metal or composite repairs should be reported through the normal incident or accid@@ ent reporting process ( e.g. , failure , malfunction , or defect reports required by 14 C@@ FR 2@@ 1.3 or service difficulty reports required by 14 C@@ FR 12@@ 1.@@ 703 ) .
the inspection of bonded repairs , including the specified inspection methods , interval and detection criteria , must be defined based on substanti@@ ating tests , analy@@ ses , tri@@ als , and other safety risk mi@@ tig@@ ation procedures .
though the FAA is not required to follow this policy in the same manner as we would be required to follow a regulation , this policy is how the FAA exp@@ ec@@ ts to generally apply certain approvals for installation of NOR@@ SEE for parts 27 and 29 Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
3.@@ 7.@@ 1 The primary Ad@@ FC signals that provide the so@@ le control of the aircraft must have an additional level of sc@@ r@@ ut@@ in@@ y that is not covered in the current Part 27 and 29 regulations , since those regulatory requirements only address mechanical flight control systems .
if the date of application prece@@ des the effective date of the final policy sta@@ tement , and the methods of compliance were coordinated with and approved by the FAA ( or its de@@ sig@@ ne@@ e ) , then the applicant may choose to either follow the previously acceptable methods of compliance or follow the guidance contained in this policy sta@@ tement .
if the date of application prece@@ des the effective date of the policy and the methods of compliance have already been coordinated with and approved by the FAA or its de@@ sig@@ ne@@ e , the applicant may choose to either follow the previously acceptable methods of compliance or follow the guidance contained in this policy .
if significant changes in structural stiffness result from the failed repair , analysis for flutter and other aero@@ elastic in@@ sta@@ b@@ il@@ ities must be performed to ensure the failed repair does not lead to other flight safety issues .
it addresses the compliance issues for approval of bonded repair and related size limits that mi@@ tig@@ ate the risks of : 1 ) repairs with insufficient data for substantiation and 2 ) catastrophic structural failure due to a po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally un@@ detectable weak bond that may occur in a bonded repair . this policy applies to both critical bonded structures consisting of both composite ( mon@@ ol@@ i@@ th@@ ic and sandwich structures ) and metallic materials .
the size of a bonded repair to critical structure is first constra@@ ined to the size limits allowed by substanti@@ ating repair design data , including considerations for material &amp; process control , static strength , flutter , fatigue , damage tolerance , lightning protection and other appropriate regulations for the specific critical structure .
as a result , all critical structure must have a repair size limit no larger than a size that maintains limit load residual strength capability with the repair completely failed , or failed within ar@@ re@@ sting design features .
this policy sta@@ tement recogn@@ izes the Ro@@ tor@@ craft Ad@@ van@@ ced Flight Controls ( Ad@@ FC ) Handbook for use as guidance for certification of parts 27 and 29 Ro@@ tor@@ craft Ad@@ FC systems , such as fly-by-wire and fl@@ y-@@ by-@@ light systems , by FAA certification personnel .
3.@@ 8.@@ 2.@@ 1.2 on@@ set characteristics of each envelope protection feature must be smooth , appropriate to the phase of flight and type of maneuver , and not in conflict with the ability of the pilot to satisfactorily change aircraft flight path , speed , or attitude , as needed .
the means of compliance ( visual , au@@ dit@@ ory , or tac@@ ti@@ le cu@@ eing ) must be effective during maneuvers typical to the type , especially during divided attention operations , and for represen@@ tative environmental conditions .
the Ro@@ tor@@ craft Ad@@ FC Handbook lists compliance finding methods that may apply to type certificate , am@@ ended type certificate , supplemental type certificate , and am@@ ended supplemental type certification programs .
this policy discu@@ sses compliance methods that apply to type certificate , am@@ ended type certificate , ST@@ C , and am@@ ended ST@@ C programs with an application date that is on or after the effective date of the final policy .
airframe and system tolerances ( both manufacturing and in@@ - service ) and non-@@ steady atmospheric conditions , in any appropriate combination and phase of flight , should not produce a limited flight parameter beyond the nominal design limit value .
however , the probability of failure or malfunction of these system ( s ) should also be considered and if it is shown not to be extremely Impro@@ bable then further load conditions with the system in the failed state should be evaluated .
I ) With the system in the failed state and considering any appropriate re@@ configuration and flight limitations , it should be shown that the Ro@@ tor@@ craft structure can withstand without failure the loading conditions of CS 29.@@ 351 , when the man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re is performed in accordance with the provisions of the this AM@@ C .
3.@@ 8.@@ 2.@@ 5.2 Body rate en@@ ve@@ lo@@ pes defined in Ro@@ tor@@ craft pitch and roll rates and cyclic control position should be established , and any FEP that is present that limits body rates should prevent mast bu@@ mping and ensure that no structural limits within the mast or other Ro@@ tor@@ craft components are exceeded .
if the FAA accep@@ ts the above system classification as NOR@@ SEE , this policy allows system approval while satis@@ fying only D@@ AL C with Level C software or A@@ EH and with a probability of failure on the order of 1@@ x@@ 10-5 .
this is necessary to conve@@ y that this particular NOR@@ SEE system and equipment installation is not approved where the system or function is required by any regulation , including operational regulations , without further showing .

due to the high pilot workload during an O@@ E@@ I category A takeoff , the pilot is not allowed to man@@ i@@ pu@@ late the alternate air source controls until at@@ taining V@@ TO@@ SS ( takeoff safety speed ) and a positive rate of climb .

an AM@@ L ST@@ C is a variation of a multiple ST@@ C that af@@ for@@ ds the shar@@ ing of common certification data for a product being installed , while still requiring all unique certification data for each specific model included on the AM@@ L .
3.@@ 1.@@ 2.@@ 1.1 Load limits should be derived from the limit loads from the conditions specified in 14 C@@ FR parts 27 and 29 sub@@ part C , taking into account the be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or of the active load alle@@ vi@@ ation functions for the specified limit maneuver or gust condition .
3.@@ 1.@@ 2.@@ 3.2 If pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ bing a restricted flight envelope in a failure state , it should be demonstrated that the restricted flight envelope provides for normal flight maneuvers and ex@@ cur@@ sions resulting from normal atmospheric distur@@ b@@ ances without exceeding structural limits .
for example , Research of Ro@@ tor@@ craft response types has resulted in conce@@ p@@ ts such as Rate Command / Attitude Hold , Attitude Command / Attitude Hold , and Trans@@ la@@ tional Rate Command , where response types are related to the intended operational situation in terms of visual cues .
when ex@@ pan@@ ding these size limits or using alternate materials , processes , tool@@ ing and / or inspection procedures , the larger or alternate repair will generally require additional data that qual@@ if@@ ies bonded material and process compa@@ ti@@ b@@ il@@ ities , demon@@ strates proof of structure , and establi@@ shes reliable inspection procedures .
special Condition Requirement # 4 : installations of re@@ chargeable lithium batteries must meet the requirements of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations ( 14 C@@ FR ) 23 / 25 / 27 / 29.@@ 8@@ 63 ( a ) through ( d ) for part 23 , 25 , 27 , and 29 aircraft .

special Condition Requirement # 9 : the instructions for continued airworthiness ( IC@@ A ) required by § § 23 / 25 / 27 / 29.@@ 15@@ 29 must contain maintenance requirements to assure that the battery is sufficiently charged at appropriate intervals specified by the battery manufacturer and the equipment manufacturer that contain the re@@ chargeable lithium battery or re@@ chargeable lithium battery system .
this is required to ensure that lithium re@@ chargeable batteries and lithium re@@ chargeable battery systems will not degrade below specified amp@@ e@@ re-@@ hour levels sufficient to power the aircraft system , for intended applications .
to obtain TSO author@@ ization , an applicant must meet the design assurance level specified in the TSO standard or obtain approval to deviate by demon@@ stra@@ ting an equivalent level of safety to the TSO under 14 C@@ FR 2@@ 1.@@ 609 .
3.@@ 6.1 The need for improved safety standards for Transport Category airplanes configured with advanced crew alerting systems caused the FAA to update § 25.@@ 13@@ 22 , through am@@ en@@ d@@ ment 131 , to address crew alerting of failures or malfunctions in critical systems and functions of mod@@ er@@ n aircraft .
except that the mandatory replacement times , mandatory inspection intervals , and related procedures are specified as those associated with structural integrity - including those approved under current SEC . X@@ X@@ .@@ 57@@ 1. therefore , while the requirement specifically includes those items approved under § § 27.@@ 571 or 29.@@ 571 , we have never been limited to only those items .
in the event that the resulting sideslip angle is greater than the value defined by the  line in Figure 1 , the Ro@@ tor@@ craft should be trimmed to that value of the angle using less than maximum cockpit direc@@ tion@@ al-@@ control deflection by taking into consideration the man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re entry airspeed ( see Note 2 ) .
any increase in loads and stresses in critical parts due to ice acc@@ re@@ tion must not adversely affect the capability of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft to meet the structural requirements of CS 29 when the Ro@@ tor@@ craft is operated within the established flight limitations associated to limited icing operations .
Wh@@ il@@ st it is the objective of this special condition to allow limited approval of Ro@@ tor@@ craft not equipped with full ice protection systems , any system or item of equipment essential for the safety of flight must be fully protected against full icing envelope .
this investig@@ ation should include the loads that result from the man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re , specifically initiated at the intermediate airspeed which is co@@ incident with the intersection of the line and the resultant sideslip angle ( point A in Figure 1 ) .
( D ) Ano@@ ther method of compliance may be used with a ra@@ tional analysis ( dynamic sim@@ ulation ) , acceptable to the A@@ gency / Authority , performed up to V@@ H or V@@ N@@ E whichever is less , to the maximum yaw capability of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft with recovery initiated at the resulting sideslip angle at its associated airspeed .
a strict interpre@@ tation of the referenced part 21 regulations would require an applicant for a design approval to submit all testing and analysis necessary to demon@@ st@@ rate compliance with the applicable airworthiness requirements .
the certification specification CS 29.@@ 351 provides a minimum safety standard for the design of Ro@@ tor@@ craft structural components that are subjected in flight to critical loads combinations of anti-@@ torque system thrust ( e.g. tail rotor ) , inertia and Aero@@ dynam@@ ics .
however , compliance with this standard according to FAA AC 29 may not nec@@ ess@@ arily be adequate for the design of Ro@@ tor@@ craft structural components that are pr@@ inc@@ i@@ p@@ ally subjected in flight to significant aerodynamic loads ( e.g. vertical empennage , fins , co@@ w@@ l@@ ings and doors ) .
in lieu of acceptable design criteria developed by the applicant , a suitable combination of sideslip angle and airspeed for the design of Ro@@ tor@@ craft components subjected to aerodynamic loads may be obtained from a sim@@ ulation of the yaw man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re of CS 29.@@ 351 , starting from the initial directional control input specified in CS 29.@@ 351 ( b ) ( 1 ) and ( c ) ( 1 ) , until the Ro@@ tor@@ craft reaches the maximum transient sideslip angle ( over@@ swing ) resulting from its motion around the yaw axis .
2.4 An existing FAA approval may also not be sufficient , without further showing , when installing a part in a different manner , location , or environment , because this could result in different applicable fl@@ am@@ ma@@ bility requirements that must be ac@@ coun@@ ted for to show compliance .
limiting the bonded repair size to su@@ stain minimum loads with the bond failed or failed within constraints of the ar@@ re@@ sting design features ( in the repair or base structure ) is an acceptable approach to address potential weak bonds .
when comp@@ lying with 14 C@@ FR 23.@@ 57@@ 3 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( i ) , all part 23 critical structure must have a bonded repair size limit no larger than a size that allows limit load strength &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; per loads defined in 23.@@ 57@@ 3 ( a ) ( 3 ) &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; to be achieved with the repair failed or failed within constraints of the ar@@ re@@ sting design features ( in the repair or base structure ) .
however , in the lack of full compliance with CS 29.@@ 10@@ 93 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( i ) , EAS@@ A may accept additional limitations that could result from engine induction system exposure to full icing envelope , provided that these limitations , when reached , are adequately annunci@@ ate to the flight crew to trigger a v@@ ac@@ ating man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re .
a control@@ -@@ syste@@ m@@ -@@ limiting device may be used , however the probability of failure or malfunction of these system ( s ) should be considered ( See AM@@ C No 2 to CS 29.@@ 351 inte@@ raction of System and Structure ) .
where Vibration health Monitoring is used as a compensating provi@@ sion to meet CS 29.@@ 5@@ 47 ( b ) , the design and performance of the vibration health monitoring system should be approved by requesting compliance with CS 29.@@ 14@@ 65 ( a ) .
after leaving the limited icing conditions , the applicant should then demon@@ st@@ rate that while crossing the warm de-icing layer , the induction system would natu@@ rally de-@@ ice and the normal operating conditions are restored .
for Ro@@ tor@@ craft for which certification with emergency flo@@ tation provisions is requested by the applicant , in accordance with CS 29.@@ 802 ( b ) : if the passenger capacity of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft is less than 10 passengers , the structural conditions apply only to the flo@@ tation units and their attachments to the Ro@@ tor@@ craft , otherwise they apply to the complete Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
the level of integrity of the monitoring and annunci@@ ating system should be co@@ m@@ men@@ su@@ rate to the cri@@ ticality of the engine ( s ) loss or mal@@ functioning due to monitoring and annunci@@ ating system failure according to CS 29.@@ 1309 ( b ) ( 2 ) .
the combination of contra@@ sting physical phenomena ( like ice acc@@ re@@ tion and sh@@ ed@@ ding caused by centrifugal and aerodynamic forces ) which prevent an un@@ protected rotating blade from being significantly affected from icing conditions , provided that icing parameters remain within a certain envelope , does not apply to other Ro@@ tor@@ craft equipment that are exposed to icing .
if these equipment are essential for the continu@@ ation of a safe flight then it is EAS@@ A op@@ ini@@ on that , in order to guarantee an adequate level of safety , they have to be protected against full icing envelope .
however , as for the engine induction system , EAS@@ A may consider acceptable additional limitations for the limited icing envelope that could result from essential equipment exposure to full icing envelope , provided that the reached limitations are annunci@@ ate in due time to the crew in order to trigger an escape man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re .
the level of integrity of the monitoring and annunci@@ ating system should be co@@ m@@ men@@ su@@ rate to the cri@@ ticality of the equipment failures ( including mis@@ leading indications ) as a result of the monitoring system failure according to CS 29.@@ 1309 ( b ) ( 2 ) .
the existing indu@@ stry training materials , such as SAE AIR-@@ 57@@ 19 (Te@@ aching Points for an Awareness Class on Critical I@@ ssues in Composite Maintenance and Repair ) , note that reverse engineering practices will generally not equi@@ p the De@@ sig@@ ner with a full understanding of the knowledge basis that is necessary to expand repair size limits defined in the SRM .
the O@@ EM documents design , specifications , procedures , tool@@ ing and substanti@@ ating data that pro@@ ves the damaged structure can be repaired to its original type certified condition within the specified repair size limits .
Wh@@ il@@ st it is the objective of this special condition to allow limited approval of Ro@@ tor@@ craft not equipped with full ice protection systems , any system or item of equipment essential for the safety of flight must be fully protected against the effects of ice and low temperatures e.g. pitot &amp; static systems , Wind@@ screens , engine in@@ takes .
the following Special Condition ( S@@ C ) has been classified as important and as such shall be subject to public consultation in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 12 / 200@@ 7 dated 11 Se@@ p@@ te@@ mber 200@@ 7 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) which states :
the standards for engine installation are partially related to the combustion principle assuming rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating / piston engines are spark ignition O@@ t@@ to cycle engines using pe@@ tro@@ l based fuel while turbine engines are continuous combustion tur@@ bo@@ shaft engines using kerosene based jet fuel .
V@@ H@@ M is used to increase the li@@ k@@ eli@@ hood of detection of dynamic component inc@@ i@@ pi@@ ent faults in the rotors and rotor drive systems that could prevent continued safe flight or safe landing , by providing timely indications of potential failures to maintenance personnel .
in the design phase of the pilot compartment , when considering the external flight crew view , applic@@ ants may therefore choose to start by using the guidance already available in AM@@ C and AC material relevant to 2@@ X@@ .@@ 773 Pilot compartment view , while keeping in min@@ d the differences related with V@@ TO@@ L aircraft and In@@ no@@ v@@ ative Air Mo@@ bility ( I@@ AM ) Operations .
additives that are needed for turbine fuels that will also be required by a Ro@@ tor@@ craft di@@ es@@ el engine ( ex@@ . anti-icing and biocide additives ) will be referred to as part of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft fuel specifications .
( II ) The external visual cues necessary to safely control the aircraft might differ depending on the phase of flight , as i.e. in the V@@ TO@@ L phase the crew may focus on ground details ( ch@@ in bubbles ) to fly a given tra@@ jec@@ tory or hold a position , while in forward flight they might only need to have a visible horizon .
using the appropriate ce@@ tan@@ e rated fuel in a di@@ es@@ el engine is critical to ensure proper engine starting at low temperatures and to avoid flame@@ -out events in low power conditions especially at high altitude , at low temperatures , and at low engine speed ( low rpm )
fuels that do not have a specification ( such as certain pro@@ te@@ in or plan@@ t-@@ based fuels ) will be handled on a ca@@ se-@@ by-@@ case basis ( e.g. compa@@ tibility issues of the fuel system materials must be add@@ ressed such as ela@@ stom@@ ers , sealants , seals , lin@@ ers , hoses , composite parts , etc . ) .
as part of the basic compliance ef@@ for@@ ts for a Ro@@ tor@@ craft di@@ es@@ el engine , the effects of higher vibration levels higher than those that are typical for conventional rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating engine powered Ro@@ tor@@ craft must be considered .
even if such Electronic Control systems are not unique to Ro@@ tor@@ craft di@@ es@@ el engines , recent conventional rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating engines controlled by FADEC have been certified on the basis of a Special Condition to accommodate this design feature which had not been en@@ vi@@ s@@ aged in the development of C@@ Ss .
the primary concern is that the vibra@@ tory loads imp@@ ar@@ ted to the Ro@@ tor@@ craft by a di@@ es@@ el engine with one cylinder inoperative may be in excess of what previous experience has shown on conventional rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating engines , thereby reducing the margin of design safety .
( I ) when using this material , applic@@ ants should consider the differences between the V@@ TO@@ L expected tra@@ jec@@ tories and flight attitudes envelope compared to conventional aircraft , and the CON@@ OPS that will be carried out by the crew in terms of traffic / obstacle see and avoid .
( II ) deviations from the current material can be j@@ us@@ tified by the reasons in ( i ) but also by design characteristics of the V@@ TO@@ L aircraft ( can@@ ards , lift / thrust systems forward of the crew compartment view ) .
if the design however is a single panel windshield , the applicant can demon@@ st@@ rate by analysis and / or flight test that the loss of vision through the single panel is partial and that the remaining external field of view will allow for continued safe flight and landing .
Con@@ sequ@@ ently , a sto@@ pp@@ age Cri@@ teri@@ on as defined in CS 27.@@ 361 ( a ) ( 4 ) for turbine engines is made applicable for di@@ es@@ el engines instead of the CS 27.@@ 361 ( b ) for rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating ( spark ignition ) engines , 
or a factor of four , for a four cylinders should con@@ serv@@ a@@ tively be used to multiply the aircraft di@@ es@@ el engine mean torque to calculate the limit torque , unless it is shown by the applicant that other ( lower or higher ) factors are adequate .
for example , several materials within the cabin were exempt from compliance with § 25.@@ 8@@ 53 ( a ) and were used to con@@ struct parts such as stowage bins , stowage boxes , seat surrounds ( Ex@@ e@@ mption 97@@ 91 and subsequent revisions ) .
? when comp@@ lying with 14 C@@ FR 25.@@ 571 , 27.@@ 57@@ 3 and 29.@@ 57@@ 3 , all part 25 PSE and parts 27 and 29 critical structures have a minimum required residual strength of limit load ( as defined in the regulations for each type of aircraft ) .
considering that there is limited histor@@ ical experience regarding the use of di@@ es@@ el engine on Ro@@ tor@@ craft , and that much higher cylinder pressures exist in di@@ es@@ el engines , there is a possibility that the engine torque output to the transmission could exceed the highest engine to transmission torque limit when the output is not directly controlled by the pilot under normal operating conditions need to be evaluated .
Tur@@ bo@@ charged engines have higher cylinder pressures than conventional rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating engines and have an important influence on engine per@@ for@@ man@@ ces , compression level in the air intake and engine ad@@ mission .
the Stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ ea@@ n Rules of the Air establish in SER@@ A@@ .@@ 50@@ 10 the conditions under which an ATC unit can author@@ i@@ se a h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter to operate within a control zone under Special VFR clearance , including certain weather minima .
Di@@ es@@ el tur@@ bo@@ charged engine operating characteristics should be investig@@ ated in flight to determine that no adverse characteristics ( such as over@@ boost , surge ) are present , during normal and emergency operation .
C@@ S-@@ 27 contains fuel icing standards that are limited to Turbine engines based on the fact that they are operating with kerosene based fuels which are more susceptible to water absorption and to icing .
the modification of a small Ro@@ tor@@ craft with the installation of a di@@ es@@ el engine ( on a product that is already powered by a conventional rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating engine ) will lead to two different vari@@ ants in operation :
Note : flight conditions may be exc@@ luded from the evaluation , if the probability of occurrence of the failure mode combined with the probability of being in the flight condition is shown to be extremely Impro@@ bable .
this might not completely prevent mis@@ fu@@ el@@ ling with AV@@ GAS of a di@@ es@@ el engine , which may be critical for a Di@@ es@@ el engine installation and special attention might also be needed when ass@@ ess@@ ing CS 27.@@ 15@@ 57 and CS 27.@@ 15@@ 21 .
( a ) Unless other temperatures are dee@@ med more critical , -4 ° C to + 1 ° C ( 25 ° F to 34 ° F ) being -2 ° C to + 1 ° C desirable ( 28 ° F to 34 ° F ) should be used , as conduc@@ ive to wet snow conditions , which ten@@ ds to accumula@@ te on un@@ heated surfaces subject to imp@@ ing@@ ement .
as an example , CS 27.@@ 15@@ 21 ( f ) regarding ambient temperature is only applicable to turbine engines , however , the fuel freezing point might be lower on di@@ es@@ el engine fuel and ambient temperature limitations would then be required .
Tw@@ en@@ t@@ y-@@ five minutes , or the maximum allowed time in relation the aircraft limitations , under these extreme conditions is considered a reasonable maximum , both from the view of pilot stress and the maximum expected taxi time prior to take off in bad weather .
their be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our in the different flight phases should be ass@@ essed and the safety Assessment should en@@ compass the potential failure modes and associated effects ( temperature , high energy debris , vibration , etc . ) .
( C ) The du@@ rations reported in the table above are minimum test duration times based on experience with Ro@@ tor@@ craft operations , to ensure that the snow acc@@ re@@ tion on the aircraft and windshield is represen@@ tative of a wor@@ st-@@ case sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o .
C@@ S-@@ 27 does not provide adequate specifications for the installation and qualification of liquid cooling system equipment and mainly only addresses the per@@ for@@ man@@ ces aspec@@ ts of the cooling system under CS 27.@@ 10@@ 41 , CS 27.@@ 10@@ 45 and CS 27.@@ 10@@ 47 which were considered sufficient for air cooled rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating engines .
the expected action at the expi@@ ration of this specified time would be landing or transition to a safe flight condition where it has been shown that snow accumula@@ tions will not intensi@@ fy or shed and so not cause unacceptable reduction in pilot vi@@ sibility .
( a ) Each tur@@ b@@ o charger system is considered to be part of engine therefore it must be certified within the scope of the engine type certificate or it must be shown that the tur@@ b@@ o charger system , while in its normal engine installation and operating in the certified engine environment -
while it is an exc@@ ellent development tool , artificial snow production devices are usually restricted to use for ho@@ ver and ground evalu@@ ations , and the snow p@@ el@@ lets produced by these machin@@ es are not sufficiently similar to natural s@@ no@@ w@@ flakes to j@@ us@@ tify the use of artificial snow as the so@@ le basis of certification .
( 2 ) If certification for flight in snow conditions is requested , it should be demonstrated that snow , both falling and blowing , does not accumula@@ te on the V@@ TO@@ L windshield and windows so that crew external view of the flight path and sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ings is not un@@ du@@ ly imp@@ ai@@ red during taxiing , ho@@ ver flight , take-off , level flight and landing .
( B ) If di@@ es@@ el engine torque output to the transmission can exceed the highest engine or transmission torque rating limit , and that output is not directly controlled by the pilot under normal operating conditions ( such as where the primary engine power control is accomplished through the flight control ) , the following test must be made :
( 1 ) For normal conditions without failures , malfunctions , or adverse conditions , all combinations of altitudes and speeds en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ed by the VD versus altitude envelope , enlarged at all points by an increase of 20 percent in equivalent airspeed at constant altitude , should be considered .
( B ) For IFR operations , the airspeed should range from the minimum IFR speed or the minimum for snow operations up to the maximum cruise speed or the maximum speed specified for snow operations in the flight manual limitations , unless other air@@ speeds are dee@@ med more critical .
( a ) Di@@ es@@ el tur@@ bo@@ charged Engine operating characteristics must be investig@@ ated in flight to determine that no adverse characteristics ( such as over@@ boost , surge ) are present , to a hazardous degree , during normal and emergency operation within the range of operating limitations of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft and of the engine .
( a ) The specified vi@@ sibility assu@@ mes that visual measurements are made in falling snow in the absence of fog or recircu@@ lating snow by an observer at the test site outside the tests V@@ TO@@ L area of influence .
( C ) For g@@ overn@@ or@@ -@@ controlled engines , it must be shown that there exists no hazardous torsional in@@ stability of the drive system associated with critical combinations of power , rotational speed , and control displacement .
( VI ) If it becomes apparent that snow accumula@@ tions in ground and IG@@ E ho@@ ver operations in recircu@@ lating snow are much more severe than in the level flight test , it is reasonable to accept prolonged IG@@ E operations in recircu@@ lating snow and to accept du@@ rations of less than 1-@@ hour level flight , or maximum expected flight duration .
( D ) Each fuel system for a kerosene based engine must be capable of su@@ sta@@ ined operation throughout its flow and pressure range with fuel initially saturated with water at 27 ° C ( 80 ° F ) and having 0.19@@ 8 cc of free water per lit@@ re ( 0.75 cc per US gallon ) added and cooled to the most critical condition for icing likely to be encountered in operation .
( VII ) For the level flight portion , if after a reasonable time it is no@@ tic@@ ed that there is no snow accumulation that would imp@@ air the pilot vi@@ sibility , the duration of the level flight may be reduced accordingly .
for test purposes , recirculation should be the highest snow concentration at@@ ta@@ in@@ able in the man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re , or that corresponding to the lowest vi@@ sibility at which ( in the pilot judgment ) control of the V@@ TO@@ L is possible in the IG@@ E condition .
for structural elements or parts and failure modes identified in ( a ) ( 5 ) ( II ) , if a quantitative Assessment is not directly feasible , an acceptable combination of compensating provisions should be implemented that provides sufficient confidence to achieve the safety objective and is appropriate to address the failure mode that could result in catastrophic con@@ sequ@@ ences .
therefore , it is assumed that a h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter certified for day and night VFR can perform ho@@ ver flights in re-@@ circu@@ lating snow , take-off and land under snow falls , and fly with falling snow compatible with the Special VFR limit vi@@ sibility .
( B ) Each suction lift fuel system and other fuel systems with features conduc@@ ive to vapo@@ ur formation must be shown by test to operate satisfactorily ( within certification limits ) when using fuel at the maximum temperature determined under paragraph ( a ) under critical operating conditions including , if applicable , the engine operating conditions defined by CS 27.@@ 9@@ 27 ( b ) ( 1 ) and ( b ) ( 2 ) .
CS 27.@@ 13@@ 02 A@@ m@@ d@@ t . 8 , as per the guidelines defined in its AM@@ C 27.@@ 13@@ 02 , is accepted as a means of compliance with V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2600 regarding the design and approval of installed equipment that is intended for use by the crew members from their normal seating positions in the cockpit with the following considerations :
( a ) CS 27.@@ 13@@ 02 and its AM@@ C 27.@@ 13@@ 02 apply to the crew interfaces and system be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our for all the installed systems and equipment used by the crew in the cockpit while operating the V@@ TO@@ L aircraft in normal , abnormal / malfunction and emergency conditions .
( B ) The functions of the crew members operating from the cabin need to be considered if they may interfere with the ones under the responsibility of the cockpit crew , or if dedicated airworthiness requirements are included in the rules .
it is considered that the safety objec@@ tives for C@@ S-@@ 25 and C@@ S-@@ 27 / 29 aircraft should be maintained as a minimum for V@@ TO@@ L aircraft in the Category enhanced , i.e. intended for operations over con@@ ge@@ sted areas or for commercial air transport of passengers .
( 1 ) The functions of the crew members operating from the cabin should be considered if they may interfere with the ones under the responsibility of the cockpit crew , or if dedicated airworthiness requirements apply .
( C ) CS 27.@@ 13@@ 02 A@@ m@@ d@@ t . 8 , as per the guidelines established in AM@@ C 27.@@ 13@@ 02 , is accepted as a means of compliance with V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 26@@ 05 ( b ) and ( c ) regarding the design of crew interfaces and be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our of installed systems and equipment used by the crew in the cockpit while operating the V@@ TO@@ L aircraft in normal , abnormal abnormal / malfunction and emergency conditions .
( a ) The test required by CS 27.@@ 9@@ 65 ( b ) must be replaced with a similar test using the sum of the pressure developed during the maximum ultimate acceleration with a full tank or a pressure of 24 kPa ( 3.5 psi ) , whichever is greater , plus the maximum working pressure of the system ;
( 4 ) publications which are considered to provide appropriate standards for the design substantiation and certification of s@@ y@@ m@@ bo@@ lic placards may include , but are not limited to , &@@ a@@ po@@ s@@ ; General Aviation manufacturers Association ( GAM@@ A ) Publication No. 15 - Sym@@ bo@@ lic Messages , Initial Issue , 1 Mar@@ ch 20@@ 14 .
( B ) For a tank with a non-metallic liner the test fluid must be coolant rather than fuel as specified in CS 27.@@ 9@@ 65 ( d ) and the slo@@ sh test on a specimen liner must be conducted with the coolant at operating temperature .
( E ) For electronically controlled rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating engine Ro@@ tor@@ craft , no single failure or malfunction , or Probable combination there@@ of , in any power@@ plant control system may cause the failure of any power@@ plant function necessary for safety .
- therefore a Special Condition is considered necessary to add a paragraph to 29.@@ 15@@ 21 requiring that any duration of continued operation after gearbox loss of oil is substanti@@ ated by test data and reduced by a safety factor derived by analysis .
for ke@@ ro@@ sen@@ e-@@ based engines , ambient temperature limitations ( including limitations for win@@ teri@@ zation installations , if applicable ) must be established as the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature at which compliance with the cooling provisions of CS 27.@@ 10@@ 41 to 27.@@ 10@@ 45 is shown .
the potential of persons in@@ ad@@ ver@@ ten@@ tly falling from the vehicle , and the ph@@ y@@ si@@ ological effect on passengers , should be included in the event classification , in addition to effects on the vehicle structure , systems , control@@ la@@ bility etc .
as part of the basic compliance activity for a Ro@@ tor@@ craft di@@ es@@ el engines , the effects of vibration levels higher than those typical for conventional rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating engine powered Ro@@ tor@@ craft should be considered .
the primary concern is that the vibra@@ tory loads imp@@ ar@@ ted to the Ro@@ tor@@ craft by a di@@ es@@ el engine may be in excess of what experience has shown on conventional rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating engines , thereby reducing the margin of design safety .
in respect to the existing AM@@ C to C@@ S.@@ 27.@@ 603 , AM@@ C to C@@ S.@@ 27.@@ 9@@ 61 ( which is applicable to MO@@ C SC@@ - DI@@ E@@ .@@ 9@@ 61 ) and AM@@ C to C@@ S.@@ 27.@@ 9@@ 63 which are applicable , the following should be considered for di@@ es@@ el engine installations :
the vibration levels of a di@@ es@@ el engine might be greater than those for conventional rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating engines and could under certain circumstances be significantly higher ( such as in the case of an inoperative cylinder ) .
it should also provide information on how to ensure the absence of reg@@ ress@@ ion in case of new or updated host platforms ( e.g. Operating System update ) or when new software application versions are released .
( D ) Au@@ th@@ or@@ is@@ ed host platform configuration : host platform configuration with characteristics ( e.g. input / output hardware characteristics , Operating System version , Central Processing Unit ( CPU ) type , CPU frequency , memory ) for which the e@@ AFM performance and integrity are guaran@@ te@@ ed .
Note : particular cases of author@@ is@@ ed host platform configuration are the worst case author@@ is@@ ed host platform configurations that correspond to the configurations with minimum characteristics ensuring the e@@ AFM performance and integrity .
when mixed with water , the fl@@ am@@ ma@@ bility aspect of Eth@@ ylene glycol is significantly lower but a few reports from the car indu@@ stry and laboratory experi@@ ences have shown that under certain atmospheric conditions , and depending on the water concentration , a residual part of the mixture can still be flammable when water is evapo@@ rated ( bo@@ iling , spray on ignition surface etc ) .
if it is not part of the type design definition ( e.g. in the case of non-@@ installed equipment such as portable CO@@ TS equipment ) , the list of host platform configuration characteristics and their author@@ is@@ ed range will be identified as conditions for the e@@ AFM approval .
when installing such a system at aircraft / Ro@@ tor@@ craft level it is important to consider in the design that a mixture of Eth@@ ylene glycol and water decreases the fl@@ am@@ ma@@ bility characteristic based on the water presence / concentration .
however , as the engine TCH might provide different possi@@ b@@ il@@ ities ( water@@ less or mix with water under different concentrations ) it is important to correctly define the expected approach at installation level so that the appropriate design criteria will adequately cover the potential fire risk .
( C ) If the host platform is non-@@ installed equipment ( not part of the type design definition ) , the list of author@@ is@@ ed host platform configuration characteristics and the range in which those characteristics may e@@ vol@@ ve while ensuring the correct performance of the e@@ AFM .
the use of water@@ less coolant ( such as propylene glycol ) would automatically imply flammable fluid which would need to be considered as such during the compliance demon@@ stration of the coolant tank , coolant lines and pipes , radi@@ ator , drainage , etc .
EAS@@ A and other authorities have already published an Airworthiness Direc@@ tive to prohibit the use of water@@ less coolant in engine cooling installations that are non-@@ compli@@ ant with flammable fluid related standards at aircraft level .
considering that Eth@@ ylene glycol when mixed with water has a low fire risk exposure compared to water@@ less coolant it has been accepted at engine level to not consider the liquid as being flammable to facilitate the installation and heat disp@@ er@@ sion with simp@@ ler design ;
( C ) Identification of the approval status of the e@@ AFM ( data file version , SW application version , etc . ) should be made readily available to the end user via a dedicated function or permanently displayed .
the in@@ stal@@ ler should then clearly define which coolant mix is author@@ is@@ ed for the engine cooling system , assess the fluid characteristics and potential influ@@ en@@ cing parameters which could lead to a higher exposure to fire risk , and define any necessary limitations .
( a ) The integrity and reliability of the e@@ AFM software application ( s ) running on an author@@ is@@ ed host platform should be co@@ m@@ men@@ su@@ rate with the safety objec@@ tives defined for their identified failure conditions .
( 1 ) If the software application is intended to be installed on non-@@ installed equipment , not part of the type design definition , such as Commercial Off@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ Shelf ( CO@@ TS ) platforms and possibly under control by the operator , the lack of development assurance of the platform should be compensated for by at least the following :
those limitations could be on water concentration in the aircraft maintenance manual in accordance with CS 27.@@ 15@@ 29 , engine temperature to limit the water evaporation or / and bo@@ iling point , complete and regular servicing to maintain coolant characteristics , etc .
it should include in particular exten@@ si@@ ve@@ 6 verification of the e@@ AFM functionality , including ro@@ b@@ ust@@ ness test cases , in a rep@@ e@@ at@@ able and standar@@ dis@@ ed manner and for the wor@@ st-@@ case author@@ is@@ ed platform configurations .
in addition , even if not considered flammable fluid as per C@@ S-@@ Definitions , for the fluid tank , lines , radi@@ ator characteristic , design precautions should still be taken to minim@@ i@@ se the risk of having a leak in direct exposure to ignition surfaces such as exhaust pipes or tur@@ bo@@ charger surfaces , especially in a va@@ por@@ is@@ ed form which could lead to rapid evaporation of the water .
( 3 ) An additional verification procedure should be developed and provided to end users , as part of the e@@ AFM installation information , for them to ensure adequate verification of the e@@ AFM functionality on their final host platform configuration ( s ) .
( C ) host Platform : the hardware and basic software ( e.g. operative System ( OS ) , input / output software ) environment that enables the operation of the software application to input , process and output the e@@ AFM information to the end user .
( E ) Software running on installed equipment : if the e@@ AFM is intended to be hosted in installed equipment ( part of the type design definition ) , the host platform characteristics are fully defined ( at the time of its certification ) ;
the FADEC will need electrical power for continuous operation and will include inputs from Ro@@ tor@@ craft data , power sources and outputs to other Ro@@ tor@@ craft systems ( i.e. engine instruments , electrical power supply and there control ) .
( B ) The risk of inadvertent changes to the aircraft configuration is properly mi@@ tig@@ ated , e.g. by means of di@@ sc@@ la@@ im@@ ers and warning messages displayed on the screen and / or confirmation actions to be performed in order to implement the change ;
( 1 ) If the e@@ AFM includes a performance computation function , by which the crew can calculate and display the aircraft performance both during the flight preparation and in flight , the following additional considerations apply .
the basis of certification for the B@@ ell Hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter Tex@@ tr@@ on Can@@ ad@@ a ( BH@@ T@@ CL ) Model 429 h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter includes Certification Specification C@@ S@@ 27 - Normal Category Ro@@ tor@@ craft , Initial Release that adopts 30-@@ second / 2-@@ minute OEL Power .
the rated 30-@@ second OEL power is limited to periods of not over 30 seconds at any one time and may be used to enhance the OEL performance of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft during the transient phase of the take-off and landing man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ res .
this dual-@@ engine h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter has a no@@ vel or unusual design feature associated with the automatic engine power li@@ mi@@ ters , in that there is a provi@@ sion for the crew to selec@@ tively override the limits associated with rated 30-@@ second OEL power .
following an in-flight failure or a precautionary shutdown of an engine , Ro@@ tor@@ craft certificated for a 30-@@ second OEL power rating must provide a means to automatically activate and control the engine power and prevent any engine from exceeding the installed engine limits associated with the 30-@@ second OEL power rating approved for the Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
Ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less activities that lead to check real time properties , memory overflow and hardware failure check like detection of failure to satisfy execution time requirements , in@@ ability of built-in test to detect failures and st@@ ac@@ ks overflow are not applicable .
following use of 30-@@ second OEL power , subject to confirmation by mandatory maintenance inspection , engines and other Ro@@ tor@@ craft components are typically expected to be fit for return to service without any overhaul or repair .
however , it is recognized that , specific to the Model 429 , the automatic devices that activate and control the 30-@@ second OEL power also continue to protect power sensitive components of the transmission and rotor drive system from excessive loads , stresses or other damaging conditions .
( B ) database Ass@@ urance : databases used for performance calculation should be produced using standard indu@@ stry processes such as DO-@@ 200 ( ) / ED@@ -@@ 76 ( ) , to a level co@@ m@@ men@@ su@@ rate with the failure effects identified in the safety Assessment .
as such , the Model 429 30-@@ second OEL power rating does not closely approach the ultimate power capabilities ( i.e. there is a safety margin ) of the engines nor inflict damage upon the engines during each use , as expected by the power levels en@@ vi@@ s@@ aged by the applicable standards for certification with a 30-@@ second / 2-@@ minute power rating .
( D ) Interface aspec@@ ts : the applicant should substanti@@ ate that the e@@ AFM performance calculation function is designed to minim@@ i@@ se mista@@ kes or mis@@ understanding by a trained user during data input and interpre@@ tation of output .
in the case of an exce@@ p@@ tional emergency when close to the ground , such as an up@@ set or wind gust causing imminent collision with terrain , BH@@ TC has requested the In@@ corpo@@ ration into the Model 429 of a limit override switch , allowing the pilot to ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se jud@@ g@@ ement to access all available ( ne@@ ar@@ - ultimate ) engine power as a last res@@ ort to recover the aircraft or to reduce the se@@ ver@@ ity of impact with terrain .
the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally damaging aspec@@ ts of this feature are offset by the increased safety provided to the Ro@@ tor@@ craft and its occupants by preventing or le@@ ss@@ ening the effect of collision with terrain or other obstacles .
for this purpose , guidance on Air Operations Regulation for human Machine Interface and human Fac@@ tors aspec@@ ts of Electronic Flight Bags , such as AM@@ C1 SP@@ A@@ .@@ EF@@ B@@ .@@ 100 ( b ) ( 2 ) and paragraph ( f ) of AM@@ C5 SP@@ A@@ .@@ EF@@ B@@ .@@ 100 ( b ) ( 3 ) , may be considered .
( B ) TC holders may have the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge , under the Authority of their DO@@ A / PO@@ A , to define the content of each individual aircraft e@@ AFM ( cu@@ sto@@ mi@@ sed e@@ AFM ) , by selecting the appropriate approved parts from the envelope e@@ AFM , according to the known configuration of this individual aircraft , and , if needed , the particular requests of the Authority of the coun@@ try of reg@@ istration of the aircraft , and distribute this e@@ AFM to the operator .
with respect to the limit override feature , when activated , the engine would be limited to integrity limits rather than the op@@ en@@ -@@ ended engine operation to destruction capability that would be allowed by certification to the 2 ? -@@ minute OEL power rating standard .
( a ) If the approved e@@ AFM is intended to be the one applicable to all fleet and incorpo@@ rating all kits , clear instructions on how to cu@@ stom@@ ize this e@@ AFM application ( s ) should be available for operators .
( B ) As some e@@ AFM information ( e.g. limitation , procedures , etc . ) may be applicable to a single or limited number of aircraft only , it should be specified how this information will be managed and conve@@ yed into the customized e@@ AFM , cl@@ ar@@ ifying also in which cases such information may take precedence and replace the one of the basic e@@ AFM .
EAS@@ A con@@ si@@ ders that safety after an engine failure under this proposed Special Condition will be at least equivalent to operational safety provided by compliance to the applicable standards for a 2 ? -@@ minute OEL rated h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter .
during OEL operation , where the operating engine is automatically limited to the rated 30 second OEL power , a means is provided for the pilot to selec@@ tively override the automatic limiter in order to allow the remaining operational engine to operate within its integrity limit .
the capability to override the automatic limiter is intended for a one-time use , as a last res@@ ort safety feature to allow pilots to recover from extreme emergency to prevent or reduce the effect of collision with terrain or other obstacles .
therefore , ex@@ cer@@ p@@ ts or co@@ pi@@ es under any format ( printed , .@@ p@@ d@@ f , .@@ j@@ p@@ g , .@@ x@@ ps , .@@ p@@ n@@ g , etc ) of any part of or of the entire e@@ AFM directly from the software application ( s ) should be either not allowed or considered and marked as un@@ controlled .
in particular , if allowed , the extraction of information for building up operational documentation should not imp@@ air or cor@@ rupt the technical content , the structure and the presen@@ tation format of the approved e@@ AFM .
( B ) The software application ( s ) should ensure at any time se@@ gre@@ gation and clear distinc@@ tion of the approved data from non-@@ approved ones , in particular when interactive functions of the software are in use .
it is recommended that the applicant approved design Organization ensures that it identifies and imp@@ lements all needed processes specific to the e@@ AFM , covering in particular aspec@@ ts such as electronic au@@ th@@ oring and distribution of the e@@ AFM , normal revisions , third par@@ ty changes ( such as resulting from supplemental Type certific@@ ates ) , and ur@@ gent content or software revisions resulting from Airworthiness Directives requirements .
the holders of type certific@@ ates are responsible for ensuring that there is enough and accurate information in the IC@@ A and that they are delivered in a timely manner to maintain the continued airworthiness of the product .
( 2 ) The limit override function can only be activated when the control has been selected during an OEL event ( in case of selection with all engines operating or outside OEL power range , it shall be necessary to de-@@ select and re-@@ select the cockpit control to arm the limit override feature ) ;
C@@ S-@@ 27 27.@@ 15@@ 29 A@@ m@@ d@@ t . 6 and referenced C@@ S-@@ 27 Appendix A is accepted as means of compliance together with additional associated guidelines given in FAA AC 27-@@ 1B Change 7 Appendix A and comple@@ mented by those ela@@ bo@@ rated below .
( 2 ) any failure in the means to select the limit override feature , or in the inoperative engine E@@ EC , shall not prevent the limiter in the operative engine to automatically control to rated 30-@@ second OEL limits ;
( 2 ) It shall be demonstrated by flight test and analysis that the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter and engine under test are free of hazards and an@@ om@@ al@@ ies during selection and operation of the 30-@@ second OEL limit override feature .
IC@@ A can be published in documents or in a manner that is outside the traditional understanding of a document , for example , as a series of web pages , or in a pu@@ b@@ li@@ shing format linked to tasks or data modules rather than pages .
the EAS@@ A Certification Me@@ m@@ or@@ and@@ um C@@ M@@ -@@ ICA@@ -@@ 001 Comp@@ le@@ ten@@ ess and timely availability of Instructions for Continued Airworthiness provides guidance on the comple@@ ten@@ ess and timely furni@@ shing of IC@@ A to the operator / o@@ w@@ ner and any other person required to comply with any of those instructions .
this approach , previously utili@@ sed for the development of C@@ S-@@ 23 A@@ men@@ d@@ ment 5 , is also used for V@@ TO@@ L designs in order not to limit technical in@@ no@@ vation by describing pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ ptive design solutions as certification standards .
either this information is directly integrated in the TCH V@@ TO@@ L air@@ cra@@ ft@@ - , Lift / thrust un@@ it@@ - or ET@@ SO@@ - top-level IC@@ A , if applicable in accordance with the technical standard applied , or it is provided in the supplier documentation ( as for example Component Maintenance Manu@@ als ( CMM ) , Ven@@ dor Service Bulletins ( VS@@ B ) ) .
some of these MO@@ Cs contain material which should be considered to be guidance material to assist the applicant with an understanding of the objective rather than providing a defini@@ tive means of compliance .
if top-level IC@@ A contain discard or remove and replace instructions for certain components ( including system testing and other instructions ensuring that the product will be put in an air@@ wor@@ th@@ y state by such replacement ) , and do not refer to supplier documentation for necessary airworthiness actions , then the V@@ TO@@ L aircraft airworthiness is maintained by discard / replacement action , and the supplier documentation is not part of the IC@@ A .
the means Of Compliance ( MO@@ C ) contained within this document address the applicant ′ s requests for cl@@ ar@@ ification of EAS@@ A interpre@@ tation of these objec@@ tives and of possi@@ b@@ il@@ ities how to demon@@ st@@ rate compliance with them .
it is not the intent of EAS@@ A to en@@ force a specific selection / range of manuals , names and their abbreviations , apart from manuals / sections , which are referenced in requirements , like the Airworthiness Limitations in V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 26@@ 25 ( c ) .
in addition , the proposed MO@@ Cs should enable an equal treatment of all applic@@ ants , by establi@@ shing a level pla@@ ying field and ensuring that a comparable level of safety in the compliance with the objec@@ tives of the Special Condition is achieved by all designs .
in case of se@@ gre@@ gation of information dedicated to a specific subject from a principal manual ( like the Aircraft Maintenance Manual ( AMM ) or Standard Practices Manual ( SPM ) ) into a separate manual , e.g. Cable Fa@@ br@@ ication Manual , Duct Repair Manual or Instrument Display Manual , these manuals are considered as IC@@ A .
it will fur@@ ther@@ more allow the indu@@ stry to gain an early in@@ sight into EAS@@ A interpre@@ tation and exp@@ ec@@ tations from the design objec@@ tives of the Special Condition which could have an important effect in the design decisions , instead of waiting until exha@@ us@@ tive guidance for the Special Condition is developed .
on the other hand , certain information dedicated to a specific subject may be integrated in a principal manual ( as e.g. tro@@ u@@ ble@@ -@@ shooting information as part of the Aircraft Maintenance Manual ( AMM ) instead of a separate Trouble Sho@@ ut@@ ing Manual ( TS@@ M ) ) .
{ P1 } From take-off until reaching V@@ TO@@ SS ( see MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 21@@ 15 ) and from below VREF ( see MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2130 ) to landing ( i.e. the ground referenced phase ) , at least 17 kts of relative steady wind should be considered .
{ P1 } After reaching V@@ TO@@ SS and until VREF is achieved prior to landing ( i.e. in an air referenced phase ) , the effect of the relative wind ( and g@@ ust@@ s ) should be considered on handling qualities , using the M@@ H@@ Q@@ R@@ M , and on performance .
E@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally , in integrating and cross-@@ linking documentation into a common database , a class@@ ical manual structure ( e.g. in accordance with previous ATA 100 standard ) , a set of manuals like AMM , WDM , TS@@ M ... , may be not visible .
in the con@@ text of data base management , aspec@@ ts like the production of data , its valid@@ ation and verification , data sub@@ mission , trac@@ eability of up@@ dates , data security and relevant operational requirements should be defined and ex@@ pla@@ ined by the applicant .
following a fat@@ al accid@@ ent of a Part 29 h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter in 2009 , and the associated accid@@ ent investig@@ ation , the FAA , EAS@@ A and T@@ CC@@ A set up a Joint Certification Team in order to review Part 29 rules and AC which affect the li@@ k@@ eli@@ hood of loss of transmission oil and the con@@ sequ@@ ences of such an event on the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter .
( B ) The performance data should be determined with the most critical wind condition identified in ( a ) , in nominal conditions and at the certified Minimum Performance ( C@@ MP ) following a Critical Failure for Performance ( CF@@ P ) , which should in any case include :
the E@@ Con@@ v@@ TO diff@@ ers from the Con@@ v@@ TO operation in that a dro@@ p@@ down below the surface level is allowed provided obstacle clearances ( 15@@ ft of edge clearance ) are maintained until reaching the take-off safety speed V@@ TO@@ SS ( defined below ) .
the design Assessment must include a detailed failure analysis to identify all failures that will prevent continued safe flight or safe landing , and must identify the means to minim@@ i@@ se the li@@ k@@ eli@@ hood of their occurrence .
1 ) so that the reliability of the lubrication system will be ass@@ essed against power@@ plant / rotor drive system specific requirements , it should be considered to be part of the rotor drive system and included in the definition of 29.@@ 9@@ 17 ( a ) .
2 ) Rotor drive system lubrication systems are part of the power@@ plant Installation as defined in 29.@@ 901 . 
the AC material states  while this procedure is usually straight forward , the following items of FAA / AUTH@@ ORITY power@@ plant responsibility are listed to minimize qu@@ es@@ tions regarding authority and responsibility : ( VI@@ II ) Oil systems for engines , auxiliary power units , rotor drive transmissions , and gearboxes , including grease lubricated gears and bearings of the drive system . 
however , histor@@ ically the requirement of 29.@@ 901 ( c ) has sometimes only been applied to the engine installation .
( B ) A third take-off path , Vertical Take-Off ( V@@ TO ) ( Figure 1 ) , is also proposed with the objective of providing an adap@@ ted take-off path for V@@ TO@@ L ur@@ b@@ an environment operations from ver@@ ti@@ ports ( see Vertical take-off and landing procedure in section 13 ) :
3 ) The safety of the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter after an event of loss of gearbox oil is dependent upon a combination of the ability of the gearbox to continue operation without oil , the flight conditions and the duration for which the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter is flown . 
accordingly , the parameters defined in the associated Flight Manual Emergency Procedures are critical in order to reduce the li@@ k@@ eli@@ hood of continued operation up to the point of gearbox failure .
( C ) If certification with ditching provisions , emergency flo@@ tation provisions or limited over water operations is requested by the applicant , each emergency control that may need to be operated underwater should be marked with the method of operation and be marked with yellow and black stripes .
this includes gearboxes , sh@@ af@@ ting , universal joints , coup@@ l@@ ings , rotor brake assemblies , clutches , supporting bearings for sh@@ af@@ ting , any attendant accessory pads or drives , any cooling fans and any associated lubrication system components including oil cool@@ ers , 
that are a part of , attached to , or mounted on the rotor drive system .
this includes gearboxes , sh@@ af@@ ting , universal joints , coup@@ l@@ ings , rotor brake assemblies , clutches , supporting bearings for sh@@ af@@ ting , any attendant accessory pads or drives , and any cooling fans that are a part of , attached to , or mounted on the rotor drive system .
? CS 29.@@ 901 ( c ) For each power@@ plant and auxiliary power unit installation , it must be established that no single failure or malfunction or Probable combination of failures will j@@ e@@ op@@ ar@@ di@@ se the safe operation of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft except that the failure of structural elements need not be considered if the probability of any such failure is extremely remote .
in addition , the J@@ CT considered that existing Part / CS 29 regulations do not adequately address the reliability of rotor drive system lubrication systems , particularly with respect loss of oil , and that this should also be add@@ ressed by changes to the rule and / or AC .
some applic@@ ants might elec@@ t to have a T@@ DP lower than the top of the vertical segment , if the RTO cannot be performed safely from a given height upwards while meeting the certified Minimum Performance ( C@@ MP ) following a Critical Failure for Performance ( CF@@ P ) .
the maximum duration of operation after a loss of oil resulting in a red oil pressure warning may not be greater than the maximum value demonstrated by test , reduced by a suitable safety factor to account for vari@@ ability of gearbox components due to design tolerances and wear
( C ) The differences between the three pro@@ files li@@ e only at the initial portion of the take-off tra@@ jec@@ tory and acceleration to forward flight , until V@@ TO@@ SS and a positive rate of climb ( Ro@@ C ) are achieved .
the applicant applied to EAS@@ A for approval of an ST@@ C for the installation of an auxiliary ga@@ se@@ ous oxygen system in the AW@@ 139 Ro@@ tor@@ craft to be used as a supplemental source , i.e. , to prevent hy@@ po@@ xi@@ a .
the AW@@ 139 is a large Ro@@ tor@@ craft designed by A@@ gu@@ sta@@ -@@ We@@ st@@ land and approved by EAS@@ A as Category A and Category B , according to a Certification Ba@@ sis established on J@@ AR 29 A@@ men@@ d@@ ment 3 ( dated A@@ pri@@ l 1st , 200@@ 2 ) ( see CR@@ I A-1 ) .
different take-off heights can be considered if compatible with the departure and en@@ -route structure , in particular accele@@ rating from V@@ TO@@ SS to VFTO at a higher altitude allows to leave the obstacle environment faster .
such special conditions will include both requirements ADDRES@@ SING the minimum performance standards of the oxygen flow ( ph@@ y@@ si@@ ological aspec@@ ts ) and requirements ADDRES@@ SING design aspec@@ ts ai@@ ming at minim@@ is@@ ing the additional explosion / fire risk associated to the installation of oxygen press@@ ur@@ is@@ ed lines .
other guidance material related to the installation of ga@@ se@@ ous oxygen lines on un@@ press@@ ur@@ is@@ ed aircraft ai@@ med at minim@@ izing the fire / explosion hazard associated to the oxygen line installation are contained in AC 29-@@ 2C M@@ G-@@ 6 ( E@@ MS Systems - Oxygen installation ) , AC 43-@@ 13-@@ 2B , SAE AIR@@ 822 and SAE AIR@@ 825 .
( C ) The aircraft should reach V@@ TO@@ SS and should continue at a speed as close as practical to , but not less than V@@ TO@@ SS , until it is 61 m ( 200 ft ) above the take-off elevation , with a minimum gradient of climb at each point .
( E ) For the E@@ Con@@ v@@ TO , the aircraft may descend below the level of the take-off surface if , in so doing and when Clear@@ ing the elev@@ ated ver@@ ti@@ port edge , in normal and CF@@ P , every part of the aircraft clears all obstacles by at least 15 ft .
if radio equipment is installed , the flight crew oxygen disp@@ en@@ s@@ ing units must be designed to allow the use of that equipment and to allow communication with any other required crew member while at their assigned duty station .
( H ) Starting at the point at which the aircraft reaches 200 ft above the take-off elevation ( or the vir@@ tual elev@@ ated ver@@ ti@@ port in the case of the V@@ TO ) , the aircraft should be accelerated to the Final Take@@ -off Speed ( VFTO ) and should then be capable of a directional tra@@ jec@@ tory change with at least 3 ° / s :
based on maximum operating altitude for which the approval of the oxygen system is required , h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter performance and hazards associated to the loss of oxygen , applic@@ ants could comply with the provisions of sub-@@ paragraph II above through appropriate system design characteristics that , in case of failure of one system , give priority to the pilots in the oxygen distribution system .
Note : the take-off performance must be determined for all associated mass , atmospheric and wind conditions ( see MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2105 ) so that , in case of the occurrence of the CF@@ P event at any time after the start of take-off , the aircraft can either return to , and stop safely on the take-off area , or continue the take@@ - off and climb out .
for each passenger , the minimum mass flow of supplemental oxygen required at various cabin pressure altitudes may not be less than the flow required to maintain , during in@@ spi@@ ration and while using the oxygen equipment ( including masks ) provided , the following mean tra@@ che@@ al oxygen partial pressures :
( a ) &@@ a@@ po@@ s@@ ; D means the diameter of the smallest circle en@@ closing the V@@ TO@@ L aircraft projection on a horizontal plane , while the aircraft is in the take-off or landing configuration , with rotor ( s ) turning if applicable ( Figure 3 ) .
( B ) If the V@@ TO@@ L aircraft changes dimension during taxi or parking ( e.g. folding wings ) and the positions of the cen@@ tr@@ e of the smallest en@@ closing circle varies , the corresponding locations should also be provided .
the minimum mass flow of supplemental oxygen supplied for each user must be at a rate not less than that shown in the following figure for each altitude up to and including the maximum operating altitude of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
( a )  Final approach and take-off area ( FA@@ TO ) means a defined area over which the final phase of the approach man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re to ho@@ ver or land is completed and from which the take-off man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re is co@@ m@@ men@@ ced .
( a ) Re@@ jected take-off distance ( R@@ TO@@ D ) means the length of the FA@@ TO dec@@ la@@ red available and suitable for V@@ TO@@ L aircraft to complete a rejected take-off in accordance with the Category in which it is operated , enhanced or Basic .
at cabin pressure altitudes above 30@@ 48@@ m ( 10 000 ft ) up to and including 54@@ 86@@ m ( 18 000 ft ) , a mean tra@@ che@@ al oxygen partial pressure of 100 mm Hg when breathing 15 li@@ ters per minute , Body Temperature , Pressure , saturated ( B@@ T@@ PS ) and with a ti@@ d@@ al volume of 700 cc with a constant time interval between re@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tions .
for each f@@ ligh@@ t-@@ crew member , the minimum mass flow may not be less than the flow required to maintain , during in@@ spi@@ ration , a mean tra@@ che@@ al oxygen partial pressure of 14@@ 9 mm Hg when breathing 15 li@@ ters per minute , B@@ T@@ PS , and with a maximum ti@@ d@@ al volume of 700 cc with a constant time interval between re@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tions .
if demand equipment is installed for use by f@@ ligh@@ t-@@ crew members , the minimum mass flow of supplemental oxygen required for each crew@@ member may not be less than the flow required to maintain , during in@@ spi@@ ration , a mean tra@@ che@@ al oxygen partial pressure of 122 mm Hg when breathing 20 li@@ ters per minute B@@ T@@ PS .
( a ) The applicant may provide a procedure for a vertical take-off and landing , with a vertical segment from the ground facil@@ it@@ ating clearance of obstacles , for example in the ur@@ b@@ an environment ( Figure 4 ) .
for testing purposes , oxygen can be replaced by an inert gas ( e.g. nitrogen ) , however relationship between pressure and temperature would not be simulated by the inert gas and should be separately analyzed .
( E ) The rest of the take-off procedure ( e.g. take-off decision point , drop down , climb segments ) should be designed with respect to the horizontal plane at H2 , representing the vir@@ tual elev@@ ated ver@@ ti@@ port . 
pressure limiting devices ( e.g. relief valves ) , designed to protect parts of the system from excessive pressure , should prevent the pressures from exceeding the applicable maximum working pressure multiplied by 1 ? 33 in the event of malfunction of the normal pressure controlling means ( e.g. pressure reducing valve ) .
( C ) The values reported must represent tra@@ jec@@ tories demonstrated to be exec@@ u@@ table consistently by flight crew of average skill in atmospheric conditions expected to be encountered in service , as required by V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2105 ( c ) .
the values reported should ensure the con@@ tainment of the aircraft during the procedure , for example TO@@ back will be larger for a back-up take-off procedure and FA@@ TO@@ front should consider the Re@@ jected take-off distance ( R@@ TO@@ D ) .
( a )overall length means the largest length of the V@@ TO@@ L aircraft projection on a horizontal plane , while the aircraft is in the take-off or landing configuration , with rotor ( s ) turning if applicable .
in ass@@ ess@@ ing whether such hazard exists consideration should be given to the quantity and discharge rate of the oxygen released , the volume of the compartment into which it is discharging , the rate of ventilation within the compartment and the fire risk due to the installation of any po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally flammable fluid systems within the compartment .
each element of the system should have sufficient strength to withstand the maximum working pressures and temperatures in combination with any externally applied load , aris@@ ing from consideration of limit structural loads that may be ac@@ ting on that part of the system in service .
the maximum working pressure should include the maximum normal operating pressure , the transient and surge pressures , tolerances of any pressure limiting means and possible pressure variations in the normal operating modes .
strength demon@@ stration using proof and burst pressure coefficients specified in Table 1 below is acceptable , unless higher stresses result when elements are subjected to combined pressure , temperature and structural loads .
( IV ) The ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion cycle should be designed in such a way that all selected components and their defects are monitored with an adequate frequency ir@@ respective of any interrup@@ tions in the cycle due to the operational profile .
( a ) following a critical failure for performance ( CF@@ P ) and with the remaining lift / thrust engines at maximum continuous power , if approved , or at take-off power for aircraft for which certification for use of take@@ - off power is requested ;
B@@ T@@ PS means Body Temperature , and Pressure , saturated ( which is , 37 ° C , and the ambient pressure to which the body is exposed , minus 47 mm Hg , which is the tra@@ che@@ al pressure displaced by water vapo@@ ur pressure when the brea@@ thed air becomes saturated with water vapo@@ ur at 37 ° C ) .
the rated 2- minute OEL power is limited to periods of not over 2 minutes at any one time and may be used to achieve initial stabilized climb of at least 100 feet per minute following takeoff or bal@@ ked landing flight with one engine inoperative .
there should be means for direct visual inspection of the latching mechanism by crew members to determine whether the external doors ( including passenger , crew , service , and cargo doors ) are fully latched .
except for flexible lines from oxygen outlets to the disp@@ en@@ s@@ ing units , or where shown to be otherwise suitable to the installation , non-metallic tubing must not be used for any oxygen line that is normally pressurized during flight .
the compartments in which oxygen system components are installed shall be ventilated in such a way that should a leak occur or should oxygen be discharged directly into the compartment from the protective and pressure limiting device if so designed ( see requirement 1@@ Error ! reference source not found . ) , a le@@ an mixture would result thereby reducing the li@@ k@@ eli@@ hood of ignition .
where in-situ charging facilities are provided , the compartments in which they are located should be accessible from outside the aircraft and as remote as possible from other service points and equipment .
in order to comply with the J@@ AR 29.@@ 1309 , the applicant should demon@@ st@@ rate that the oxygen systems and its components are designed so that the occurrence of an un@@ detected oxygen fire in remote area is extremely Impro@@ bable .
to assess the con@@ sequ@@ ences of system / component failures , an Oxygen Haz@@ ards Analysis ( OH@@ A ) should be provided as a part of compliance with the 29.@@ 1309 , taking into account the guidance defined in following section 4.@@ c
in addition , the performance of pressure limiting devices should tested on a complete system under the conditions specified in § 4.@@ c@@ .@@ i but limited to failures which are not shown to be extremely Impro@@ bable .
the following criteria should be used for compliance with V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2@@ 205 for aircraft equipped with flight control systems , aut@@ op@@ i@@ lots , stability augmentation systems , load alle@@ vi@@ ation systems , flutter control systems , fuel management systems and any other system the failure of which could affect the load condition or aero@@ elasticity characteristics of the aircraft .
( a ) The criteria defined herein only address the direct structural con@@ sequ@@ ences of the system respon@@ ses and per@@ for@@ man@@ ces and cannot be considered in isolation but should be included in the overall safety evaluation of the aircraft .
C@@ l@@ ar@@ ification has to be provided that the installed system airworthiness approval does not con@@ stitute operational approval . 
operations may be conducted with non-pressurized h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ters at pressure altitudes above 100@@ 00 ft without the provi@@ sion of supplemental oxygen equipment capable of storing and disp@@ en@@ s@@ ing the oxygen supplies required , provided the cabin altitude does not exceed 100@@ 00 ft for a period in excess of 30 minutes and never exceeds 1@@ 2500 ft pressure altitude .
when a user has a cold , the ti@@ ssue around the na@@ sal end of the E@@ ust@@ ac@@ hi@@ an tube could pro@@ ba@@ bly be sw@@ ol@@ le@@ n and experi@@ enced ear problems to be ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated in flight . 
flying at low altitude should be the best way in this case . 
this precaution may prevent a perforated or pa@@ in@@ ful ear@@ drum .
( B ) depending upon the specific characteristics of the aircraft , additional stu@@ dies may be required that go beyond the criteria provided in this appendix in order to demon@@ st@@ rate the capability of the aircraft to meet other real@@ is@@ tic conditions such as alternative gust or man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re descriptions for an aircraft equipped with a load alle@@ vi@@ ation system .
{ P1 } Operational limitations : limitations , including flight limitations , that can be applied to the aircraft operating conditions before dispatch ( e.g. , fuel , payload and Master Minimum Equipment List limitations ) .
{ P1 } Failure condition : the term failure condition is the same as that used in MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .25@@ 10 , however this MO@@ C applies only to system failure conditions that affect the structural performance of the aircraft 
e.g. , system failure conditions that induce loads , change the response of the aircraft to inputs such as g@@ ust@@ s or pilot actions , or lower flutter margins .
the following Special Condition has been classified as a new Special Condition and as such shall be subject to public consultation in accordance with EAS@@ A Management Board decision 02 / 04 dated 30 Mar@@ ch 200@@ 4 , ar@@ ticle 3 ( 2 . ) of which states :
Deviations from the applicable airworthiness codes , environmental protection certification specifications and / or acceptable means of compliance with Part 21 , as well as important special conditions and equivalent safety findings , shall be submitted to the panel of ex@@ per@@ ts and be subject to a public consultation of at least 3 weeks , except if they have been previously agreed and published in the Off@@ ic@@ ial Publication of the A@@ gency .
( 1 ) Limit loads should be derived in all normal operating configurations of the system from all the limit conditions specified in Sub@@ part C , taking into account any special be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our of such a system or associated functions or any effect on the structural performance of the aircraft that may occur up to the limit loads .
in particular , any significant non@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity ( rate of displacement of control surface , th@@ resh@@ olds or any other system non@@ lin@@ ear@@ ities ) should be ac@@ coun@@ ted for in a real@@ is@@ tic or con@@ serv@@ ative way when der@@ iv@@ ing limit loads from limit conditions .
Com@@ mission Regulation ( E@@ U ) 7@@ 48 / 2012 as am@@ ended by Com@@ mission Regulation ( E@@ U ) No 69 / 20@@ 14 requires that for applicable aircraft a set of Operational Su@@ it@@ ability Data ( OS@@ D ) is approved as part of the Type Certificate , and being included in the Type Certificate Data Sheet ( T@@ CD@@ S ) .
EAS@@ A has developed a set of requirements that are contained in the Certification Specifications CS ‐ MMEL for complex motor ‐ powered aircraft and CS ‐ GEN ‐ MMEL for non ‐ complex aero@@ planes and those can be used to define the applicable MMEL Certification Ba@@ sis .
no specific requirements were established for non ‐ complex h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ters .@@ The@@ re@@ fore EAS@@ A has developed this Special Condition to define the MMEL requirements as Certification Ba@@ sis for non ‐ complex motor ‐ powered h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ters .
there should be visual means ( combined with other atten@@ tion-@@ g@@ et@@ ters as appropriate ) to signal to appropriate flight crew members when doors within the scope of this paragraph are not closed and / or not fully latched .
( III ) The exit should be provided with a suitable hand@@ hold , or hand@@ holds ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ently located inside the cabin , to assist occupants in locating and operating the exit , as well as in e@@ gress@@ ing through the emergency exit .
starting from these flight conditions , a real@@ is@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o , including pilot corrective actions , should be established to determine the loads occurring at the time of failure and immediately after failure .
( B ) The provisions for in-service Monitoring established in compliance with V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2@@ 240 ( e ) should include the necessary means to verify the health and operating conditions to help ensure the continued durability , integrity and functionality of the part .
( C ) The applicant should define an in-service Monitoring program@@ me which should verify the continuity of the effectiveness of design and maintenance provisions , as well other procedures , implemented to comply with V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2@@ 240 ( a ) and ( b ) , V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 50 ( a ) and ( c ) and V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 26@@ 25 through the life of the type design .
( E ) The ass@@ ess@@ ments required by the in-service Monitoring program@@ me should be performed at suitable periods through the complete life of the subject component types , considering the types of operation , environment and age@@ ing effects expected .
( E ) For modifications of the type design which could affect the flutter characteristics , compliance with ( a ) should be shown , except that analysis alone , which is based on previously approved data , may be used to show freedom from flutter , control re@@ vers@@ al and di@@ ver@@ gen@@ ce for all speeds up to the speed specified for the selected method .
( I ) For static strength substantiation , these loads , multiplied by an appropriate factor of safety that is related to the probability of occurrence of the failure , are ultimate loads to be considered for design .
‐ the CS ‐ GEN ‐ MMEL Initial Issue Appendix IV - Item list applicability is limited to the items as defined in Table 1 below , and comple@@ mented by items of the CS ‐ MMEL Appendix 1 to G@@ M1 MMEL@@ .@@ 145 MMEL ITEMS GUIDANCE book , as defined in Table 1 below .
( IV ) For failure conditions that result in ex@@ cur@@ sions beyond the ne@@ ver@@ -@@ exceed speed , V@@ N@@ E , freedom from aero@@ elastic in@@ stability should be shown to increased speeds , so that the margins intended by MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2@@ 245 are maintained .
in order to be pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate to the n@@ ature and risk associated to these different operational sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os , three airworthiness categories are defined : limited overwater operations , emergency flo@@ tation and ditching .
( a ) The following limit flight man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ ring conditions specified in MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 15 should be determined , at speeds up to V@@ N@@ E or the speed limitation prescribed for the remainder of the flight , unless otherwise sta@@ ted :

item title changed to Power connection for EF@@ B 4@@ 6-@@ 20-@@ 3-@@ 1B condition ( a ) replaced by  ( a ) the associated EF@@ B is used in accordance with portable EF@@ B stowage criteria ( see AM@@ C 20-@@ 26 paragraph 6.@@ 2.@@ 1.6 Vi@@ e@@ wa@@ ble stowage )
( II ) For static strength substantiation , each part of the structure should be able to withstand the loads in sub@@ paragraph ( 2 ) ( i ) of this paragraph multiplied by a factor of safety depending on the probability of being in this failure state .
for overwater operations , the combination of C@@ S@@ 27.@@ 14@@ 15 A@@ m@@ d@@ t . 5 ( or later ) and C@@ S@@ 29.@@ 14@@ 15 ( d ) A@@ m@@ d@@ t . 5 ( or later ) is accepted as a means of compliance for the installation of additional safety equipment as required by any applicable operating rule .
the factor of safety is defined in Figure 2 where 10-@@ X is equal to the probability associated to Extremely Impro@@ bable for the aircraft Category and number of passengers in accordance with MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .25@@ 10 .
each emergency locator transmitter , including sensors and an@@ ten@@ n@@ a@@ e , required by the applicable operating rule , should be installed so as to minim@@ i@@ se damage that would prevent its functioning following an accid@@ ent or incident .
( VI ) Free@@ dom from aero@@ elastic in@@ stability should also be shown up to V &@@ a@@ po@@ s@@ ; in Figure 3 above , for any Probable system failure condition combined with any damage required or selected for investig@@ ation by V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2@@ 240
the factor of safety ( F.@@ S. ) is defined in Figure 1 where 10-@@ X is equal to the probability associated to Extremely Impro@@ bable for the aircraft Category and number of passengers in accordance with MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .25@@ 10 .
where the failure analysis shows the probability of these failure to be less than the probability associated to Extremely Impro@@ bable for the aircraft Category and number of passengers in accordance with MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .25@@ 10 , criteria other than those specified in this MO@@ C may be used for structural substantiation to show continued safe flight and landing ( for Category enhanced ) or controlled emergency landing ( for Category Basic )
( 1 ) The system should be checked for failure conditions , not extremely Impro@@ bable , that degrade the structural capability below the level required by SC@@ -@@ V@@ TO@@ L or significantly reduce the reliability of the remaining system .
this MO@@ C provides methods and guidance when using sim@@ ulation ben@@ ches and test rig@@ s in the substantiation of compliance with different requirements of the SC@@ -@@ V@@ TO@@ L ( for example : V@@ TO@@ L@@ .2500 ( b ) , V@@ TO@@ L@@ .25@@ 10 , V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 213@@ 5 , etc . ) .
certain elements of the control system , such as mechanical and hydraulic components , may use special periodic inspections , and electronic components may use daily checks , in lieu of detection and indication systems to achieve the objective of this requirement .
these certification maintenance requirements should be limited to components that are not readily detectable by normal detection and indication systems and where service history shows that inspections will provide an adequate level of safety .
( 2 ) The ex@@ isten@@ ce of any failure condition , not extremely Impro@@ bable , during flight that could significantly affect the structural capability of the aero@@ plane and for which the associated reduction in airworthiness can be minim@@ is@@ ed by suitable flight limitations , should be sign@@ al@@ led to the flight crew .
for example , failure conditions that result in a factor of safety between the aircraft strength and the loads of Sub@@ part C below 1.25 , or flutter margins below V , should be sign@@ al@@ led to the crew during flight .
( a )  sim@@ ulation bench refers to a sim@@ ulator with pilot in the loop capability , when Sim@@ ulation has been agreed in the Certification Program@@ me as the means to demon@@ st@@ rate compliance with a requirement in the S@@ C V@@ TO@@ L ( See Appendix A to AM@@ C 2@@ 1.@@ A@@ .@@ 15 ( b ) ) .
if the aircraft is to be dispatched in a known system failure condition that affects structural performance , or affects the reliability of the remaining system to maintain structural performance , then the provisions of V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2@@ 205 should be met for the dispatched condition and for subsequent failures .
( B ) test rig refers to a laboratory test bench , when laboratory test has been agreed in the Certification Program@@ me as the means to demon@@ st@@ rate compliance with a requirement in the S@@ C V@@ TO@@ L ( See Appendix A to AM@@ C 2@@ 1.@@ A@@ .@@ 15 ( b ) ) .
flight limitations and expected operational limitations may be taken into account in establi@@ shing Q@@ j as the combined probability of being in the dispatched failure condition and the subsequent failure condition for the safety margins in Figures 2 and 3 .
other uses of sim@@ ulation ben@@ ches and test rig@@ s are exc@@ luded from this MO@@ C , in particular with different purposes than defined under ( a ) and ( b ) 
e.g. when supporting an Assessment if Calculation / Analysis has been agreed in the Certification Program@@ me to demon@@ st@@ rate compliance with a requirement in the S@@ C V@@ TO@@ L , or when they are not in connection with the type certification ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .
( B ) If fuel is carried in the wings or other aerodynamic elements , the maximum allowable weight of the aircraft without any fuel in this tank ( s ) should be established as maximum zero wing fuel weight or maximum zero &@@ a@@ po@@ s@@ ; aerodynamic element fuel weight , if it is less than the maximum weight .
this requires particular attention on complex , highly integrated aircraft : simula@@ tors and test rig@@ s are efficient and power@@ ful means that enable the evaluation of failure cases which sometimes could even not be tested by flight test .
tests on simula@@ tors and test rig@@ s may be agreed in the Certification Program@@ me to show compliance with some certification requirements , particularly for Handling qualities ( H@@ Q ) , Performance , Flight Controls and other systems , as well as for human Fac@@ tors ( HF ) .
the associated design criteria for these airworthiness categories have been developed following a tie@@ red approach with a baseline set of conditions defined for limited overwater operations , additional criteria necessary for emergency flo@@ tation and further considerations added for ditching operations .
this objective can be achieved by a combination of a controlled development process of simula@@ tors and test rig@@ s , sim@@ ulator configuration management , system models be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our valid@@ ation ( cross@@ checked when necessary with partial system development bench or flight test results , analysis , de@@ sk@@ top sim@@ ulation ) and engineering / operational judgment .
( a ) identify / list all sim@@ ulator ben@@ ches and test rig@@ s proposed in the Certification Program@@ me to be used for sim@@ ulation; and laboratory test compliance demon@@ stra@@ tions ( as per Appendix A to AM@@ C 2@@ 1.@@ A@@ .@@ 15 ( b ) ) .
adequately separated from electrical and fluid systems , to avoid electrical ar@@ ching - in case of conductive oxygen lines - and exposure to flammable fluids due to Probable failure or malfunctions of the related systems ;
although sim@@ ulation ben@@ ches and test rig@@ s are not subject to certification , the design of such devices for use as a certification means is dee@@ med of sufficient comple@@ xity to sti@@ pu@@ late a form@@ alized and struc@@ tu@@ red development process .
( 2 ) additionally , if certification with ditching provisions or emergency flo@@ tation provisions is requested by the applicant , the conditions considered should also be those resulting from an emergency landing into the most severe sea conditions for which certification is requested by the applicant
( 3 ) Unless other ra@@ tional landing conditions acceptable to the A@@ gency are defined , the following entry conditions apply : a forward ground speed not less than 15.@@ 4 m / s ( 30 knots ) , and a vertical speed not less than 1.5 m / s ( 5 ft / s ) , in likely pitch , roll and yaw attitudes .
the Ro@@ tor@@ craft Flight Manual , Maintenance Manual , and Engine Installation and Maintenance Manu@@ als shall provide clear descriptions , instructions , required actions following its use , and warnings for the limit over-@@ ride feature .
( 1 ) Sim@@ ulation ben@@ ches and test rig@@ s configuration should be managed si@@ mil@@ arly to the test aircraft configuration with a trac@@ eability that covers all relevant systems and models as well as the human machine interface ( H@@ M@@ I ) .
( I ) The configuration management of sim@@ ulation ben@@ ches and test rig@@ s should include the relevant elements for the test objec@@ tives ( e.g. version of the flight control laws / software , crew alerting system and the electronic check list ( EC@@ L ) for a Sim@@ ulation test ) .
it should be ensured that the nose landing gear and supporting structure is not being over@@ loaded ( by static and dynamic ( including fatigue ) loads ) during tow@@ bar@@ less towing operations with these vehicles .
( 3 ) Aircraft with watertight compartments , h@@ ul@@ l bu@@ oy@@ ancy and / or integrated bu@@ oy@@ ancy : the loads to be considered are those resulting from the aircraft entering the water , in the conditions defined in ( a ) , and in accordance with flight manual procedures .
this should be ensured by the aircraft manufacturer , either by specific investig@@ ations as described in ( b ) and ( c ) below , or alternatively , by pu@@ b@@ li@@ shing aircraft load limitations in a tow@@ bar@@ less towing vehicle Assessment document , to allow tow@@ bar@@ less towing vehicle manufacturers to demon@@ st@@ rate their vehicles will not overload the aircraft .
this MO@@ C may thus apply to any sim@@ ulator or rig test facilities when proposed to be used as a means of compliance or to support a means of compliance ( e.g. failure case evaluation to support a safety analysis ) for certification requirements .
( 1 ) The applicant should provide an OVER@@ VIEW of the general verification stra@@ teg@@ y applied for the integration of the different systems and models in sim@@ ulation ben@@ ches and test rig@@ s ( for in@@ st@@ ance , ATA@@ 1 per ATA verification including failure cases , followed by global aircraft level verification in the nominal aircraft state and flight do@@ main , then finally run of multi-@@ ATA failure cases ) .
the intent is not for EAS@@ A to verify each step of the integration or over@@ - form@@ al@@ i@@ se this process but to share an understanding of this process ( and where it is docu@@ mented ) in order to obtain confidence in the re@@ pre@@ s@@ enti@@ v@@ ity of the sim@@ ulation bench .
( 3 ) additionally if certification for ditching is requested by the applicant , any aircraft structure the failure of which would imp@@ air flo@@ tation , cap@@ size resistance or cabin e@@ gre@@ ss should be substanti@@ ated for limit and ultimate ditching loads , unless the effects of these failures are ac@@ coun@@ ted for in the investig@@ ation of Probable be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our of the aircraft during water entry , flo@@ tation , and the cap@@ size resistance demon@@ stra@@ tions .
( II ) It is also not requested to be represen@@ tative of any conditions or individual parameter , but to define first the intent of the bench ( e.g. test ( s ) intended to be performed , valid@@ ation of a procedure ) and depending on the intent , to demon@@ st@@ rate the re@@ pre@@ s@@ enti@@ v@@ ity for the part / scope that is required .
if certification with ditching provisions , emergency flo@@ tation provisions or limited over water operations is requested by the applicant , structural strength should meet the following design criteria .
( 2 ) For an agreed Sim@@ ulation compliance demon@@ stration : the certification evalu@@ ations performed in the sim@@ ulation bench are typically with an air@@ cra@@ ft-@@ level view , they cover not only the aircraft be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our or a single ATA but multiple ATA@@ s as well as the crew procedures and the workload .
( a ) If certification for only limited overwater operations is requested by the applicant , the aircraft should meet the design criteria defined for MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2310 ( b ) Emergency Flo@@ tation , with the exception that cap@@ size resistance of ( a ) ( 2 ) and ( b ) ( 2 ) need not be demonstrated .
( 1 ) Specific combinations of tow@@ bar@@ less towing vehicle ( s ) and aircraft that have been ass@@ essed as described above and have been found to be acceptable , along with any applicable towing instructions and / or limitations should be specified in the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness and in the Aircraft Flight Manual .
( 12 ) V@@ H@@ M System : typically comprises vibration sensors and associated wiring , data ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion and processing hardware , the means of downloading data from the Ro@@ tor@@ craft , the gro@@ und@@ -@@ based System and all associated instructions for operation of the system .
for these reasons , the aircraft manufacturer should ensure that the appropriate information is provided in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual and in the Aircraft Flight Manual to preclude aircraft braking during normal tow@@ bar@@ less towing .
( III ) For the system part , qualification test data , partial system bench or flight test results combined with analysis and / or engineering jud@@ g@@ ement could also be used to assess the system response compared to the related models embedded in the sim@@ ulation bench .
Wh@@ il@@ st it is recogn@@ is@@ ed that oc@@ ea@@ n waves are in general multi@@ directional ( shor@@ t-@@ cre@@ sted ) , the model tests are to be performed in unidirectional ( long-@@ cre@@ sted ) waves , this being regarded as a con@@ serv@@ ative approach to cap@@ size probability .
the loads established under MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 20 level landing , tail@@ -down and one-@@ wheel landing conditions should be applied in turn , in a 60 / 40 % distribution , to the dual wheels and t@@ y@@ res in each dual wheel landing gear unit .
( 5 ) The re@@ pre@@ s@@ enti@@ v@@ ity and limitations Assessment should also cover the dynam@@ ics of data ex@@ changes between systems during the failures and the potential dynam@@ ics ( including time de@@ la@@ ys ) intro@@ duced by the specific hardware and model architecture of the sim@@ ulation bench and test rig , when the ti@@ ming may influence the sequence of events and the system / aircraft be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our .
( II ) The re@@ pre@@ s@@ enti@@ v@@ ity and limitations ( in terms of flight do@@ main for in@@ st@@ ance ) of the simulated aircraft dynam@@ ics and the aerodynamic models ( including on aircraft the control surfaces hinge mo@@ ments and free@@ -@@ float positions ) :
if it is intended to tow the vehicle via the landing gear ( either via tow@@ -@@ bar or via direct attachment to the wheel ( s ) ) , the ground control system ( s ) , towing attachment ( s ) , and associated elements should be designed or protected by appropriate means such that during ground man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ ring operations effec@@ ted by means independent of the aero@@ plane :
( III ) depending on the design , the external vision may be used for awareness and / or as a mi@@ tig@@ ation of hazards by showing that by having parts of the aircraft visual by the crew , it is possible to identify abnormal conditions to take proper actions and safely operate the aircraft .
Note 1 : when showing compliance to CS 29.@@ 14@@ 65 ( a ) , for non-@@ required and / or partial V@@ H@@ M applications with limited capability to monitor specific failure modes , it is not necessary to address the scope of V@@ H@@ M capability sta@@ ted in Table 1 .
( II ) point ( i ) should be supported by a combination of flight test results , analysis , de@@ sk@@ top sim@@ ulation and engineering / operational judgment to provide a qualitative / reasonable Assessment of the per@@ for@@ man@@ ces re@@ pre@@ s@@ enti@@ v@@ ity , and
( I ) the re@@ pre@@ s@@ enti@@ v@@ ity of systems and sim@@ ulation means is not a key driver in the early stages of the development and should not nec@@ ess@@ arily prevent sim@@ ulation bench usage as long as the n@@ ature of the limitations does not comp@@ ro@@ mi@@ se the val@@ idity of the data to be collected .
( B ) In case of load distribution deviation from CS 27.@@ 427 ( b ) A@@ m@@ d@@ t . 6 and for designs with lift / thrust unit installation on the horizontal aerodynamic surface , the applicant is expected to provide the ra@@ tion@@ al@@ e j@@ us@@ tifying that the selected load distribution con@@ serv@@ a@@ tively addresses the limit flight load conditions of MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 15 .
( a ) If outboard fins or winglets are included on the horizontal surfaces or wings , the horizontal surfaces or wings should be designed for their maximum load in combination with loads induced by the fins or winglets and moment or forces exerted on horizontal surfaces or wings by the fins or winglets .
( C ) If outboard fins or winglets extend above and below the horizontal surface , the critical vertical surface loading ( the maximum load per unit area as determined under MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 15 ) should be applied as follows :
( 10 ) For human Fac@@ tors and Handling qualities evaluation certification tests , the applicant should present the full list of problem reports and their related cockpit effects with an Assessment of their imp@@ ac@@ ts on the represen@@ ta@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess of the certification ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .
regardless of EAS@@ A atten@@ dance or not to HF or H@@ Q evalu@@ ations , this data is expected to be directly visible in the certification data package , for example data could be included in the evalu@@ ations test reports .
( 2 ) For configurations with possible influence of the lift / thrust unit wa@@ ke on the outboard fin or winglet a con@@ serv@@ ative loading distribution should be determined , supported by flight load and / or wind tun@@ nel measurement .
V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2@@ 240 ( a ) and ( b ) requests the applicant to perform all necessary evalu@@ ations and actions ( inspection , procedures ) to prevent structural failures due to strength degradation , which could result in serious or fat@@ al injuries , or extended periods of operation with reduced safety margins .
a distinc@@ tion is thus made between categories Basic and enhanced concerning durability : while both categories have the same objective to prevent structural failures due to strength degradation , for enhanced category the detection of structural damage is added to V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2@@ 240 ( a ) .
( III ) a manual review of the critical cases ( e.g. saf@@ et@@ y-@@ critical monitors , re@@ configurations after failure ) should still be performed to identify if the dynamic of the parameters used to comp@@ ute the pass / fail criteria is correct , or to detect unexpected be@@ ha@@ vi@@ o@@ ur@@ s outside the direct parameters under analysis .
( C ) Each t@@ y@@ re installed on a retractable landing gear system should , at the maximum size of the t@@ y@@ re type expected in service , have a clearance to surrounding structure and systems that is adequate to prevent contact between the t@@ y@@ re and any part of the structure or systems .
an AP@@ RS is intended to prevent serious injuries to the occupants and third par@@ ties , during an impact onto the ground while the aircraft is suspended ben@@ eath a fully inflated pa@@ ra@@ chute system , following a serious in-flight incident .
( C ) The purpose of this MO@@ C is to off@@ er a path for demon@@ stra@@ ting compliance with the SC@@ -@@ V@@ TO@@ L of an AP@@ RS installation intended as a last res@@ ort following a failure classified as catastrophic and already meeting the corresponding probability target as per MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .25@@ 10 , without taking any cre@@ di@@ t for the AP@@ RS .
( a ) A fatigue tolerance evaluation of each Selec@@ ted Structural Element ( S@@ SE ) should be performed , and appropriate inspections and reti@@ rement time or approved equivalent means should be established to avoid C@@ atastrophic Failure during the operational life of the V@@ TO@@ L .
( 1 ) In-flight measurements to determine the fatigue loads or stresses for the S@@ SE@@ s identified in ( b ) in all critical conditions throughout the range of design limitations required in MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L 2200 ( including altitude effects ) , except that man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ ring load factors need not exceed the maximum values expected in operations .
( 2 ) The loading spec@@ tra as severe as those expected in operations based on loads or stresses determined under ( c ) ( 1 ) , including external load operations , if applicable , and other high frequency power-@@ cycle operations .
( 4 ) For each S@@ SE identified in ( b ) , a threat Assessment , which includes a determination of the Probable locations , types , and sizes of damage taking into account fatigue , environmental effects , in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c and discrete flaws , or accidental damage that may occur during manufacture or operation .
in determining inspection intervals based on damage growth , the residual strength evaluation should show that the remaining structure , after damage growth , is able to withstand design limit loads without failure .
( F ) The inspection and reti@@ rement times or approved equivalent means established under this Section should be included in the Airworthiness Limitation Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 26@@ 25
( G ) If inspections for any of the damage types identified in ( c ) ( 4 ) cannot be established within the limitations of geometry , inspec@@ tability , or good design practice , then supplemental procedures , in conjunction with the S@@ SE reti@@ rement time , should be established to minimize the risk of occurrence of these types of damage that could result in a catastrophic failure during the operational life of the V@@ TO@@ L aircraft .
if a retractable landing gear is used , an aural or equally effective landing gear warning device should be provided that functions continuously when the vehicle is in a normal landing mode and the landing gear is not fully extended and locked .
if a retractable landing gear is used , there should be a landing gear position indicator ( as well as necessary switches to actuate the indicator ) or other means to inform the pilot that each gear is secured in the extended ( or retracted ) position .
corresponding guidance for composite structure can be found in AC 27.@@ 57@@ 3 . 
the fatigue evaluation procedures outlined in this advisory material are for guidance purposes only and are neither mandatory nor regulatory in n@@ ature . 
although a uniform approach to fatigue tolerance evaluation is desirable , it is recognized that in such a complex area , new design features and methods of fabrication , new approaches to fatigue tolerance evaluation , and new configurations may require variations and deviations from the procedures described herein .
if switches are used , they should be located and coupled to the landing gear mechanical system in a manner that prevents an er@@ ron@@ eous indication of either down and locked if each gear is not in the fully extended position , or of up and locked if each landing gear is not in the fully retracted position .

further mi@@ tig@@ ation of the sources of damage may be achieved by ad@@ option of a critical parts plan to help ensure that the condition of the part remains as en@@ vi@@ s@@ aged by the De@@ sig@@ ner throughout its life cycle ( see § 29.@@ 602 ) .
however , considering the limited experience available on V@@ TO@@ L the applicant should antici@@ pate a real@@ is@@ tic and con@@ serv@@ ative spectrum ADDRES@@ SING all flight phases and flight configurations con@@ serv@@ a@@ tively .
( I ) The flo@@ tation units of the emergency flo@@ tation system and their attachments to the aircraft should comply with the structural provisions for ditching , emergency flo@@ tation and overwater operations of MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 70 ( c ) .
if certification with emergency flo@@ tation or limited over water operations is requested , the loading conditions apply to the bu@@ oy@@ ancy components provided to meet V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2310 and V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 70 ( c ) respectively , and their attachments to the aircraft .
the probability of cap@@ si@@ zing in a 5-minute exposure to the sea conditions should be demonstrated to be less than or equal to 10.0 % with a fully serviceable emergency flo@@ tation system , with 95 % confidence .
( VI ) Fur@@ ther signal En@@ han@@ cement techniques are typically required in the calculation of certain V@@ H@@ M indicators t@@ arg@@ e@@ ted at detecting specific defec@@ t-@@ related features ( e.g. lo@@ cal@@ is@@ ed signal distortion associated with a gear tooth crack ) .
( I ) The bu@@ oy@@ ancy components of the aircraft and their attachments to the aircraft should comply with the structural provisions for ditching , emergency flo@@ tation and overwater operations of MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 70 ( c ) .
( a ) Composite aircraft structure should be evaluated under the damage tolerance requirements ( d ) unless the applicant establi@@ shes that a damage tolerance evaluation is imp@@ rac@@ tical within the limits of geometry , inspec@@ tability , and good design practice .
( 1 ) Damage tolerance evalu@@ ations of composite structures should show that failure due to static and fatigue loads is avoided throughout the operational life or prescribed inspection intervals of the V@@ TO@@ L aircraft .
( C ) If certification with emergency flo@@ tation provisions is requested by the applicant , the flight manual should contain the substanti@@ ated sea conditions and any associated information relating to the certification obtained with emergency flo@@ tation provisions .
( 3 ) Each prac@@ ti@@ cable design measure , compatible with the general characteristics of the aircraft , should be taken to minim@@ i@@ se the probability that when ditching , the be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our of the aircraft would cause immediate injury to the occupants or would make it im@@ possible for them to escape .
( II ) A determination of the structural loads or stresses for all critical conditions throughout the range of limits in V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 15 ( including altitude effects ) , supported by in-flight and ground measurements , except that man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ ring load factors need not exceed the maximum values expected in service ;
the design should provide sufficient margin to prevent malfunction caused by st@@ acking up of tolerances ( due to manufacturing and installation processes ) , temperature effect , g@@ -@@ load or any other conditions encountered in the operational do@@ main .
D ) For points a ) and b ) the Flight Manual should describe in detail the required sequence of activation , the criteria for activation , the procedures to re@@ con@@ figure the pro@@ pul@@ sion system in a secure manner and any related limitations and procedures , as applicable .
( IV ) A threat Assessment for all structure being evaluated that specifies the locations , types , and sizes of damage , considering fatigue , environmental effects , in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c and discrete flaws , and impact or other accidental damage ( including the discrete source of the accidental damage ) that may occur during manufacture or operation ;

the integration of all components required for the successful functioning of the rescue system should be done in an area of the aircraft , the damaging of which is Impro@@ bable in case of mid@@ -@@ air col@@ li@@ sions and a@@ erial dis@@ integration .
( I ) Replacement times should be determined by tests , or by analysis supported by tests to show that throughout its life the structure is able to withstand the repeated loads of variable magnitude expected in-service .
( B ) Maximum acceptable manufacturing defects and in-service damage ( i.e. , those that do not lower the residual strength below ultimate design loads and those that can be repaired to restore ultimate strength ) ;
( II ) Inspection intervals should be established to reve@@ al any damage identified in the threat Assessment required by ( b ) ( 3 ) ( IV ) that may occur from fatigue or other in-service causes before such damage has gro@@ wn to the extent that the component cannot su@@ stain the required residual strength capability .
( D ) CS 27.@@ 15@@ 61 A@@ m@@ d@@ t . 5 ( or later ) is accepted as a means of compliance with V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 26@@ 05 ( d ) regarding the identification of information related to safety equipment and the marking of its method of operation .
the probability of cap@@ si@@ zing in a 5-minute exposure to the sea conditions should be substanti@@ ated to be less than or equal to 3.0 % with a fully serviceable emergency flo@@ tation system and 30.0 % with the critical float compartment failed , with 95 % confidence .
( a ) The anti-collision lights are intended to at@@ tract attention to the aircraft and they should be designed and installed to ensure minimum per@@ for@@ man@@ ces in terms of intensi@@ ties , flash rate , co@@ lo@@ ur@@ s and fi@@ elds of coverage , in order to be capable to provide sufficient vi@@ sibility in a timely manner for another aircraft to avoid a collision .
( III ) An emergency flo@@ tation system that is stowed in a deflated condition during normal flight should be designed such that the effects of a water impact ( i.e. crash ) on the emergency flo@@ tation system are minim@@ ized .
( B ) In order to show compliance with V@@ TO@@ L@@ .25@@ 30 ( a ) , any potential adverse effects of the lights operations on the satisfactory performance of the flight crew duties should be ass@@ essed , for in@@ st@@ ance cockpit reflec@@ tions or any possible effects of rotor or pro@@ p@@ eller blade stro@@ bing .
the probability of cap@@ si@@ zing in a 5-minute exposure to the sea conditions should be substanti@@ ated to be less than or equal to 3.0 % with fully functional bu@@ oy@@ ancy components , and 30.0 % with the functional loss of the critical bu@@ oy@@ ancy component , with 95 % confidence .
( C ) If certification with ditching provisions is requested by the applicant , the flight manual should contain the substanti@@ ated sea conditions and any associated information relating to the certification obtained with ditching provisions .
for in@@ st@@ ance , they could also have the purpose to comply with operational or local regulations in the intended operational environment by preventing harmful da@@ zz@@ le to outside ob@@ ser@@ vers , reducing light pollution , etc .
if an applicant establi@@ shes that the damage tolerance evaluation described in ( b ) is imp@@ rac@@ tical within the limits of geometry , inspec@@ tability , or good design practice , the applicant should do a fatigue evaluation of the particular composite aircraft structure and :
the applicant has to j@@ us@@ tify that the per@@ for@@ man@@ ces of the lights ( intensi@@ ties , flash rate , co@@ lo@@ ur and fi@@ elds of coverage ) are sufficient to satisfy the intent of V@@ TO@@ L@@ .25@@ 30 ( b ) for the specific V@@ TO@@ L aircraft design and operations ;
( 7 ) Unless the effects of the collapse of external doors and windows are ac@@ coun@@ ted for in the investig@@ ation of the Probable be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our of the aircraft during ditching and for the cap@@ size resistance demon@@ stration , the external doors and windows should be designed to withstand the Probable maximum local pressures .

the aircraft should be capable of continued safe flight and landing ( for Category enhanced ) or controlled emergency landing ( for Category Basic ) with the likely structural damage occurring as a result of
( 8 ) additionally , for Category enhanced : the aircraft design should incorporate appropriate post-@@ cap@@ size survi@@ v@@ ability features to enable all passenger cabin occupants to safely e@@ gre@@ ss the aircraft , taking into account the human bre@@ ath hold capability .
original as well as alternate or substitute material system con@@ stitu@@ ents ( e.g. , fibers , res@@ ins ) , material systems ( combinations of con@@ stitu@@ ents and adhesives ) , and composite designs ( e.g. , laminates , co@@ cured assemblies , bonded assemblies ) should be qualified in accordance with the Metho@@ do@@ logy presented in the following paragraphs .
once selected , it is recommended that team me@@ et@@ ings be held periodically ( possibly in conjunction with type bo@@ ards ) during certification to ensure the building block certification process is accomplished as intended .
the documentation includes but is not limited to the structural substantiation reports ( both analysis and test ) , manufacturing processes and quality control , and Instructions for Continued Airworthiness ( maintenance , overhaul , and repair manuals ) .
the maximum measured speed is reported in km / h to the nearest multiple of 5 , as well as the measurement standard ( here § ( c ) in MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2400 ( c ) ( 3 ) ) , in the performance section of the aircraft flight manual .

the static strength determination required by § § 27.@@ 305 and 27.@@ 307 V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2@@ 23@@ 5 establi@@ shes the ultimate load capability for composite structures that are manufactured , operated , and maintained with established procedures and conditions .

if the damage tolerant evalu@@ ations as described previously cannot be achieved within the limitations of geometry , inspec@@ tability , or good design practice , a fatigue evaluation using supplemental procedures may be proposed to the FAA / AUTH@@ ORITY EAS@@ A per § 27.@@ 57@@ 3 ( e ) Section 5 ( c ) of MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2@@ 240 ( a ) and ( b ) .
( C ) The phra@@ se if the safety ben@@ e@@ fit out@@ we@@ igh@@ s the hazard emp@@ loy@@ ed in V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 24@@ 25 ( b ) is related to the capability to restart ( or relight in the case of an internal combustion engine ) a lift / thrust unit .
it is often wor@@ th@@ while that the aircraft system allows the restart or the relight ( in case an inter@@ n@@ al@@ - combustion engine is part of the lift / thrust system ) of the lift / thrust unit that has been shut down .
the distribution and number of strain gau@@ ges should cover the load spectrum adequately for each part essential to the safe operation of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft as identified in § 27.@@ 57@@ 3 ( d ) ( 1 ) Section 5 ( b ) ( 1 ) of MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2@@ 240 ( a ) and ( b ) .
a minimum volume per passenger , in the form of an elliptical column of 70 cm x 50 cm ( 27 in. x 19 in . ) and height of 30 cm ( 11 in . ) relative to the static water@@ line should be established and demonstrated as fitting into the air pocket , including with the critical float compartment or bu@@ oy@@ ancy component failed .
the applicant should assess if manual operating procedures to restart or relight a shutdown lift / thrust unit are compatible with the workload of the crew or if the procedures should be automa@@ ted , and what are the possi@@ b@@ il@@ ities of er@@ ron@@ eous man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation of the lift / thrust unit controls during a restart / relight performed by the crew , as well as possible ways of mi@@ tig@@ ating them by design .
this type of personal protective equipment ( P@@ PE ) may provide a limited level of mi@@ tig@@ ation for the issues related to human bre@@ ath hold capability , but it should not be considered alone as being sufficient to meet the post-@@ cap@@ size survi@@ v@@ ability provisions .

( B ) E@@ u@@ ro@@ ca@@ e ED@@ -@@ 289 Guidance on the determination of accessible energy in battery systems for e@@ V@@ TO@@ L applications is accepted as a means to define the reliability of the relevant information of an electrical energy storage system to be provided to the flight crew as required by V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 24@@ 30 ( a ) ( 4 ) and established in V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 24@@ 45 ( g ) .
it should be shown that the fatigue tolerance of the structure ensures that the probability of fatigue failure is extremely remote without establi@@ shing replacement times , inspection intervals or other procedures under MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 26@@ 25 .
( B ) It should be substanti@@ ated that the strike and ingestion effects of foreign objects such as plastic bags , pa@@ pers , cleaning cloths , hand tools , rivets , bolts and screws are not hazardous to the aircraft .
( 2 ) The interval between the time when any partial failure becomes readily detectable under ( d ) ( 1 ) , and the time when any such failure is expected to reduce the remaining strength of the structure to limit or maximum at@@ ta@@ in@@ able loads ( whichever is less ) , should be determined .
( 3 ) It should be shown that the interval determined under ( d ) ( 2 ) is long enough , in relation to the inspection intervals and related procedures furnished under MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 26@@ 25 , to provide a probability of detection great enough to ensure that the probability of failure is extremely remote .
for such component it should be shown that the probability of failure is extremely remote with an approved combination of replacement time , inspection intervals , and related procedures furnished under MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 26@@ 25 .
( F ) Fatigue strength : the structure should be designed , as far as prac@@ ti@@ cable , to avoid points of stress concentration where variable stresses above the fatigue limit are likely to occur in normal service .
for example , a lift / thrust unit mounted on a ti@@ tling element is considered as a single configuration even though the aerodynamic conditions in which the lift / thrust unit operate depend on the til@@ ting angle .
( B ) The intent of V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 24@@ 35 ( g ) is therefore to provide the flight crew through the relevant V@@ TO@@ L aircraft systems , with the necessary information concerning any lift / thrust configuration that has an impact on :
( I ) Each emergency exit , including underwater exits , should be shown by test , demon@@ stration , or analysis to open without interference from flo@@ tation devices , whether stowed or deployed , and with the aircraft in any stable floating attitude .
( I ) Ditching emergency exits should be provided such that following a ditching , in all sea conditions for which ditching capability is requested by the applicant and in the intended floating attitude , passengers are able to evacuate the aircraft and step directly into any of the required life raft
( B ) In addition , for Category enhanced and Category Basic with a maximum seating configuration of 7 or more , the windshield should be evaluated for a single bird strike in accordance with V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 50 ( f ) .
( 2 ) The average load required to operate the exit release mechanism and open the exit should not exceed 22@@ 2N ( 50 lbf ) , and the maximum individual load of a test series should not exceed 24@@ 5@@ N ( 55 lbf ) .
( 3 ) Each operational device ( pull tab ( s ) , operating handle , push here decal , etc . ) should be marked with black and yellow stripes and should be shown to be accessible for the range of required flight crew heights and for both the case of an un@@ -@@ deformed seat and a seat with any deformation resulting from the test conditions required by V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 70 ( b ) ( 1 )
( 4 ) For Category enhanced : each exit , its means of access and its means of opening , should be provided with highly con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous illuminated markings that illuminate automatically and are designed to remain visible in any stable floating attitude and the cockpit FLO@@ O@@ DED .
( E ) In addition , for passenger underwater exits : underwater emergency exits should be provided in accordance with the following requirements and should be pro@@ ven by test , demon@@ stration , or analysis to provide for rapid escape with the aircraft in any stable floating attitude :
( 1 ) One underwater emergency exit , providing an unobstructed opening that will ad@@ mit a 0.48 m by 0.@@ 66 m ( 19 inch by 26 inch ) ellipse , should be installed in each side of the aircraft for each unit ( or part of a unit ) of four passenger seats .
( 4 ) The average load required to operate the exit release mechanism and open the exit should not exceed 22@@ 2N ( 50 lbf ) , and the maximum individual load of a test series should not exceed 24@@ 5@@ N ( 55 lbf ) .
( 6 ) The exit should be provided with a suitable hand@@ hold , or hand@@ holds ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ently located inside the cabin , to assist occupants in locating and operating the exit , as well as in e@@ gress@@ ing through the emergency exit .
( 7 ) For Category enhanced : each exit , its means of access and its means of opening , should be provided with highly con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous illuminated markings that illuminate automatically and are designed to remain visible in any stable floating attitude and the cabin FLO@@ O@@ DED .
( 1 ) Each emergency exit , including underwater exits , should be shown by test , demon@@ stration , or analysis to open without interference from flo@@ tation devices , whether stowed or deployed , and with the aircraft in any stable floating attitude .
the list of equipment that are essential for the continu@@ ation of a safe flight may depend on the aircraft characteristics , the parameters used to define the continuous and time limited icing envelope and the minimum crew .
the discharge from each protective and pressure limiting device should be vented overboard in such a manner as to preclude blockage by ice or contamination , unless it can be shown that no hazard exists by its discharge within the compartment in which it is installed .
additional equipment may be necessary e.g. engine intake screens , weather radar , horizontal sta@@ b@@ il@@ is@@ er de-icing bo@@ ot , ice detector . , to perform flight in limited icing clearance satisfactory operation of each item of installed equipment must be assured throughout the approved limited icing envelope .
a di@@ es@@ el engine is a rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating engine usually operating with kerosene based jet fuel in aviation applications , whe@@ re@@ as rec@@ i@@ pro@@ c@@ ating engines used on Ro@@ tor@@ craft so far have been excl@@ us@@ i@@ vely spark ignition ( O@@ t@@ to ) engines using aviation gasoline ( pe@@ tro@@ l based ) .
for single engine Ro@@ tor@@ craft , to be certified under C@@ S-@@ 27 and powered with a di@@ es@@ el engine , certain turbine engine fuel-@@ related standards should be met in lieu of the gasoline fuel related standards .
( 2 ) De@@ sig@@ ning a V@@ H@@ M system in accordance with this AM@@ C is expected to achieve the required performance together with acceptable levels of system integrity and reliability for compliance with type certification and / or operational regulations that require V@@ H@@ M of rotor and / or rotor drive systems .
( 3 ) This AM@@ C defin@@ es terms , processes , performance and standards that a V@@ H@@ M system should meet and also the support that a V@@ H@@ M approval holder should provide after the system has entered into service .
is a volume surrounding an E@@ ESS with or without an electrical thrust / lift unit that could be open or closed and able to withstand the effect of a flame and / or sparks , heat , pressure and hot parts ejection .
( II ) protected against corrosion and resistant to the heat and pressure created by a thermal RUN@@ AWAY of battery capable to su@@ stain a fire , spark or arc so that the essential elements it protects can perform their essential function .
the MO@@ C at hand provides guidance and methods for ADDRES@@ SING the fire protection of the installation of electric pro@@ pul@@ sion systems in V@@ TO@@ L using re@@ chargeable batteries as electrical energy storage system not liquid cooled &@@ #@@ 9@@ 1@@ ; step 1 &@@ #@@ 9@@ 3@@ ; .
( 4 ) V@@ H@@ M systems which satisfy this AM@@ C and that perform functions , the failure of which are ca@@ teg@@ or@@ is@@ ed as Minor or No Safety Effect ( see paragraph p . ) , can be accepted without the need for additional compliance with AC 29-@@ 2C MG@@ 15 .
( a ) Fire protection of flight controls , engine mounts , and other flight structure : flight controls , engine mounts and other flight structure located in the Fire with@@ standing Zone or explosive Fire Zone or in adjacent areas subject to the effects of fire should be con@@ structed of materials or shielded to withstand the effects of fire , so that they can perform their essential function during a time that covers at least the detection of the fire at the most adverse operating condition and an en@@ su@@ ing :
( B ) Areas adjacent to fire with@@ standing zone or explosive fire zone : components , electrical lines and fittings , located in area adjacent to Fire with@@ standing Zone or an explosive Fire Zone should be con@@ structed of such materials and located such that they will not suff@@ er sufficient damage to en@@ danger the V@@ TO@@ L aircraft if a portion of the lift / thrust unit or E@@ ESS is subject to a ch@@ ara@@ c@@ teri@@ sed flame for a time covering at least the detection of the fire at the most adverse operating condition and an en@@ su@@ ing :
( I ) as a means of demon@@ stra@@ ting compliance with an operational rule requiring h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ters be fitted with a V@@ H@@ M system and that operators of such h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ters implement procedures covering data collec@@ tion , analysis and determination of servic@@ eability ;
( D ) Each coolant system line and fitting must meet the standards of CS 27.@@ 9@@ 93 , except that the inside diameter of the engine coolant inlet and outlet lines may not be less than the diameter of the corresponding engine inlet and outlet connections .
( II ) arranged so that no discharge of e@@ m@@ it@@ ted corrosive gases , smoke , so@@ ot , parti@@ cu@@ late or flame will cause an additional fire hazard or imp@@ in@@ ge occupants or persons on the ground ( refer to Hazard Areas , as defined in paragraph ( d ) of MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2400 ( c ) ( 3 ) ) .
( B ) For items of mass which are subjected to frequent removal : in order to ensure the strength of the components throughout the service life de@@ sp@@ ite the deterioration through frequent removal , an additional factor in accordance with 27.@@ 6@@ 19 ( a ) ( 2 ) should be applied to all loading conditions .
all typical V@@ H@@ M indicators and signal processing techniques should be considered in the V@@ H@@ M design and a system safety Assessment under@@ taken to identify failure modes where V@@ H@@ M could provide early detection of inc@@ i@@ pi@@ ent failures .
a test should be performed to determine the maximum fuel temperature under the worst conditions , in terms of ambient temperature , engine maximum operating temperature without exceeding the limits , and minimum fuel quantity to be expected during normal operating conditions .
all component failure modes that could prevent continued safe flight or safe landing ( C@@ atastrophic and Hazardous failure conditions ) and for which vibration health monitoring could provide a reliable means of early detection must be identified .
areas around the aircraft where a hazard to persons or equipment may exist , for example due to moving surfaces , engine exhaust or battery venting in case of fire , should be identified and dep@@ ic@@ ted in the AFM ( see example Figure 5 ) .
this Special Condition contains the additional airworthiness standards as being necessary to ensure that the type design will provide a level of safety equivalent to the level that would result from compliance with the applicable Certification Specifications after the loss of one engine .
since the SER@@ A Special VFR rules could still be applicable for V@@ TO@@ L aircraft , it is necessary to consider the pilot view of the flight path during a flight in snow fall that is compatible with these weather minima .
previous experience together with the guidance in this AM@@ C can be used to determine failure modes that could ben@@ e@@ fit from V@@ H@@ M and the applicable techniques that can produce reliable indications of inc@@ i@@ pi@@ ent failures .
( 2 ) Single failures , malfunctions , or dis@@ connections , and any combination of these that is not extremely Impro@@ bable , of elements in the primary flight control system , tab control system , or flutter damper
in the absence of suitable certification specifications for the type certification of this type of product , a complete set of dedicated technical specifications in the form of a Special Condition for V@@ TO@@ L aircraft was developed .
the Special Condition addresses the unique characteristics of these products and pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ es airworthiness standards for the iss@@ u@@ ance of a type certificate , and changes to this type certificate , for a per@@ s@@ on-@@ carrying V@@ TO@@ L aircraft in the small category , with lift / thrust units that are used to generate powered lift and control .
first , to provide sufficient flexibility to address different ar@@ chi@@ te@@ c@@ tures and design conce@@ p@@ ts , although it is ac@@ knowled@@ ged that all possible cases cannot be considered in these MO@@ Cs and alternatives can be proposed by applic@@ ants to address some particular design features .
( 2 ) A detailed status of sim@@ ulation ben@@ ches and test rig@@ s should be established for all certification tests ( including tests performed without EAS@@ A par@@ tici@@ pation ) and bri@@ ef@@ ed along with each test order before the certification tests :
( II ) Wh@@ ere ( i ) is not possible , for in@@ st@@ ance for hazardous or catastrophic failure cases , the demon@@ stration should also include analysis ( for example , matching of system be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our expected by the design office with the sim@@ ulator bench / test rig be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our ) and comparison with partial or se@@ g@@ mented demon@@ stration of a failure case performed in flight when relevant .
since the benef@@ ic@@ ial effect on performance of ho@@ vering close to the ground is not assumed to be present for all V@@ TO@@ L designs , h@@ ence there could be no actual ground effect , the conventional IG@@ E and O@@ GE terms have been considered to be no longer applicable .
consideration should be given to the likely operation of Ro@@ tor@@ craft that may utili@@ se the V@@ H@@ M system and the prac@@ ticality of acquiring adequate data from each flight to permit the Alert and Alarm processing to be performed to the required standard .
( II ) The data ac@@ qui@@ red from the vibration signal should be automatically ga@@ thered in specifically defined reg@@ im@@ es at an appropriate rate and quantity for the V@@ H@@ M signal processing to produce ro@@ b@@ ust data for defect detection .
for Category enhanced , the climb gradient without ground effect , 305 m ( 1 000 ft ) above the take-off surface , should be at least 2.5 % , for each weight , altitude , and temperature for which take-off data are to be determined , and for the duration of the flight :
{ P1 } Flight limitations : limitations that can be applied to the aircraft flight conditions following an in-flight occurrence and that are included in the flight manual ( e.g. , speed limitations , avoidance of severe weather conditions , etc . ) .
( 11 ) V@@ H@@ M Indicator : a V@@ H@@ M Indicator is the result of processing s@@ amp@@ led data by applying an alg@@ ori@@ th@@ m to achieve a single value , which relates to the health of a component with respect to a particular failure mode .
sensor selection , positioning and installation should be designed to enable analysis of the processed signals to discrimin@@ ate the vibration characteristics of the dec@@ la@@ red monitored component failure modes .
the objective of processing the s@@ amp@@ led data should be to produce V@@ H@@ M Indicators that clearly re@@ late to vibration characteristics of the monitored components , from which the health of these components can be determined .
( 3 ) A load on nose wheel t@@ y@@ res to be compared with the dynamic rating established for those t@@ y@@ res equal to the reaction obtained at the nose wheel , assuming that the mass of the vehicle ac@@ ts at the most critical cen@@ tr@@ e of gravity and ex@@ er@@ ts a force of 1.0 g downward and 0.25 g forward , the re@@ actions being distributed to the nose and main wheels according to the principles of sta@@ tics with the drag reaction at the ground applied only at wheels with brakes .
( 2 ) 60 % of the limit drag and side@@ loads and 100 % of the limit vertical load established under the MO@@ C V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 20 side@@ load , lateral drift and bra@@ ked roll conditions , or le@@ ss@@ er vertical load obtained under ( 1 ) , should be applied in turn to each wheel in the dual wheel landing gear unit .
the aircraft should be capable of successfully completing a flight during which likely structural damage occurs as a result of { P1 } Un@@ contained high-@@ energy fragments and Su@@ sta@@ ined Imb@@ alance as specified in V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 2@@ 240 ( d ) { P2 } B@@ ird impact as specified in V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 22@@ 50
( 4 ) The area of the pilot compartment field of view that according with FAA AC 27.@@ 77@@ 34 should be free from obstruction should be used as starting point for the design : Years of experience show that this obstruction free area has ensured the functions listed in ( a ) .
examples of these processes or instructions could be : frozen manufacturing processes , Flight Critical Parts programs , material selection to mi@@ tig@@ ate in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c flaws like inclusions and defects , procedures to reduce deviations from nominal structures , etc .
( 2 ) Any non-@@ j@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ able doors intended for use after a ditching should have means to enable them to be secured in the open position and remain secure for emergency e@@ gre@@ ss in all sea conditions for which ditching capability is requested by the applicant
these replacement times , inspections , or other procedures should be included in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by V@@ TO@@ L@@ .@@ 26@@ 25 Instructions for Continued Airworthiness .
for composite structure pro@@ jec@@ ts involving Ro@@ tor@@ craft certificated to earlier certification bases ( which do not automatically include the lightning protection requirements of § 27.@@ 610 ) , these requirements should be im@@ posed as special conditions .
the vi@@ sibility specification of ? mile outside of the recirculation influence becomes in@@ con@@ sequential provided that fresh , loose snow is continu@@ ally experi@@ enced during the ground operation and IG@@ E ho@@ ver testing phase .
however , since it is intended that the test phases be accomplished sequentially to assure that transition to take off and other tr@@ an@@ si@@ ents are considered , the conditions at take off , level flight , and descent and landing should approximate the ? -@@ mile vi@@ sibility criteria .
this could be achieved through the use of redundant systems or through distributed systems where each flo@@ tation unit is capable of aut@@ ono@@ mo@@ us operation ( i.e. through the provi@@ sion of individual inflation gas sources , electrical power sources and float activation switches ) .
for example , the hoist cable or long-@@ line cable may exhibit a natural frequency that could be excited by sources internal to the overall structural system ( i.e. the Ro@@ tor@@ craft ) or by sources external to the system .
this is because the process for threshold setting is sometimes a comp@@ ro@@ mi@@ se between increasing sensitivity and inc@@ ur@@ ring a higher risk of false al@@ arms , or reducing sensitivity , which will delay the point at which a ri@@ sing indicator value will trigger an alert .
in-service experience has shown that M@@ GB component fatigue failures can propag@@ ate from initiation to failure in a relatively short period of time , thus the use of fixed th@@ resh@@ olds alone may not provide a timely indication of impending failure .
one characteristic that can often provide an earlier indication of an@@ om@@ al@@ ous be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our is the rate of change of a health monitoring indicator , and automatic trend detection software has been developed and shown to be effective .
another method , commonly referred to as Ad@@ van@@ ced Ano@@ mal@@ y Detection ( A@@ AD ) , comb@@ ines nu@@ me@@ ro@@ us indicators into multi-@@ dimensional parameters , whe@@ re@@ by simultaneous changes of multiple indicators can provide increased confidence of the an@@ om@@ al@@ ous be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our at an earlier point in the failure process .
( II ) The sensitivity of the controls should provide sufficient precision ( without being over@@ ly sensitive ) to perform tasks even in adverse environments as defined for the Ro@@ tor@@ craft operational envelope per CS 29.@@ 13@@ 02 ( c ) ( 2 ) and ( d ) .
this vertical plane is perpendicular to the inclined plane , as illustrated in Figure 1 b ) . likely Ro@@ tor@@ craft pitch , roll and yaw attitudes at water entry that would reason@@ ably be expected to occur in service , should also be considered . Auto@@ rotation , run@@ -on landing , or one-@@ engine-@@ inoperative flight tests , or a valid@@ ated sim@@ ulation should be used to confirm the attitudes selected .
( 2 ) For flo@@ ats that are fixed or intended to be deployed before water contact , CS 29.@@ 56@@ 3 ( b ) ( 1 ) defin@@ es the applicable load condition for entry into water , with the flo@@ ats in their intended configuration .
if full immersion is shown to be un@@ likely , the determination of the highest likely bu@@ oy@@ ancy load should include consideration of a partially immersed float cre@@ ating restoring mo@@ ments to compensate for the up@@ setting mo@@ ments caused by the side wind , un@@ symmetrical Ro@@ tor@@ craft loading , water wave action , Ro@@ tor@@ craft inertia , and Probable structural damage and leakage considered under CS 29.@@ 801 ( e ) .
any critical components of the suspended system and their attachments ( e.g. the cargo hook , or bol@@ ted or pin@@ ned tr@@ uss attachments ) , the failure of which could result in a hazard to the Ro@@ tor@@ craft , should be included in an acceptable fatigue analysis .
- To mi@@ tig@@ ate the case when the crew is un@@ able to , or om@@ its to , deploy a normally stowed emergency flo@@ tation system before entering the water , it should be substanti@@ ated that the flo@@ ats will survi@@ ve and function properly .
these components should be analy@@ sed or tested to ensure that their fatigue life limits are properly determined , and the limits should then be placed in the limited life section of the maintenance manual .
the flo@@ ats in their un@@ -@@ deployed condition , their attachments to the Ro@@ tor@@ craft and the local structure should be designed to withstand the water entry loads without damage that would prevent the flo@@ ats infla@@ ting as intended .
( 7 ) CS 29.@@ 86@@ 5 ( b ) and CS 29.@@ 86@@ 5 ( c ) Procedures for Quick-Release Systems and Cargo hooks : for j@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ able R@@ LC@@ s of any applicable cargo type , both a primary quick-release system ( P@@ Q@@ RS ) and a backup quick-release system ( B@@ Q@@ RS ) are required .
for dep@@ loy@@ able flo@@ ats , if an operating limitation for the deployment of flo@@ ats and / or flight with flo@@ ats deployed is given , the highest such limitation should be used , otherwise the Ro@@ tor@@ craft V@@ N@@ E should be used .
( 3 ) For flo@@ ats intended to be deployed after water contact , CS 29.@@ 56@@ 3 ( b ) ( 2 ) requires the flo@@ ats and their attachments to the Ro@@ tor@@ craft to be designed to withstand the loads generated when entering the water with the flo@@ ats in their intended condition .
( V ) Each quick-release device should be designed and located to allow the pilot or a crew member to accomplish external cargo release without haz@@ ar@@ do@@ us@@ ly limiting the ability to control the Ro@@ tor@@ craft during emergency situations .
if full immersion is shown to be un@@ likely , the determination of the highest likely bu@@ oy@@ ancy load should include consideration of a partially immersed float cre@@ ating restoring mo@@ ments to compensate for the up@@ setting mo@@ ments caused by side wind , un@@ symmetrical Ro@@ tor@@ craft loading , water wave action , Ro@@ tor@@ craft inertia , and Probable structural damage and leakage considered under CS 29.@@ 801 ( e ) .
where an operator has multiple Ro@@ tor@@ craft of the same type , facilities should be made available to the operator to support the analysis of all data ac@@ qui@@ red by the V@@ H@@ M systems in the operator fleet .
the D@@ AD should be designed to require two actions with a definite change of direction of movement , such as opening a switch or pushbutton cover followed by a definite change of direction in order to activate the release switch or pushbutton .
therefore it is necessary that the Metho@@ do@@ logy emp@@ loy@@ ed can be clearly substanti@@ ated from an understanding of how the failure mechanisms affect vibration and how the Diag@@ no@@ stic processing will generate appropriate al@@ arms .
( 1 ) Ditching : a controlled emergency landing on the water , deli@@ b@@ era@@ tely executed in accordance with Ro@@ tor@@ craft flight manual ( RFM ) procedures , with the intent of ab@@ and@@ on@@ ing the Ro@@ tor@@ craft as soon as prac@@ ti@@ cable .
( 2 ) Emergency flo@@ tation system ( EF@@ S ) : a system of flo@@ ats and any associated parts ( e.g. gas cylinders , means of deployment , pi@@ pe@@ work and electrical connections ) that is designed and installed on a Ro@@ tor@@ craft to provide bu@@ oy@@ ancy and flo@@ tation stability in a ditching .
( 2 ) For a Ro@@ tor@@ craft to be certified for ditching , in addition to the other applicable requirements of C@@ S-@@ 29 , the Ro@@ tor@@ craft must specifically meet CS 29.@@ 801 together with the requirements referenced in CS 29.@@ 801 ( a ) .
( 3 ) Ditching certification en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es four primary areas of concern : Ro@@ tor@@ craft water entry and flo@@ tation stability ( including loads and flo@@ tation system design ) , occu@@ p@@ ant e@@ gre@@ ss , and occu@@ p@@ ant survival .
the RFM or R@@ FMS should contain a clear description of the D@@ AD functionality that includes the associated safety features , normal and emergency procedures , and applicable advisory and caution messages .
( 1 ) With the Ro@@ tor@@ craft at an initial trim condition , the cockpit directional control is suddenly displaced to the maximum deflection limited by the control stops or by the maximum pilot force specified in 29.@@ 39@@ 7 ( a ) .
while the limiting conditions for water entry have been retained ( 15.@@ 4 m / s , 1.5 m / s ) , the alle@@ vi@@ ation that previously allowed less than 15.@@ 4 m / s ( 30 kt ) forward speed to be substanti@@ ated as the maximum applicable value has been removed ( also from CS 29.@@ 56@@ 3 ) .
operational experience has shown that lo@@ cal@@ is@@ ed damage or failure of a single component of an EF@@ S , or the failure of the flight crew to activate or deploy the EF@@ S , can lead to the loss of the complete system .
Note : EU@@ RO@@ CA@@ E ED@@ -@@ 12@@ C / RT@@ CA DO-@@ 17@@ 8@@ C Level D software for airborne systems and EU@@ RO@@ CA@@ E ED@@ -@@ 10@@ 9@@ A / RT@@ CA DO-@@ 27@@ 8A Ass@@ urance Level 5 for non-@@ airborne systems can be applied where V@@ H@@ M is utili@@ sed in addition to traditional h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter design provisions .
( 7 ) The sea conditions , on which certification with ditching provisions is to be based , are selected by the applicant and should take into account the expected sea conditions in the intended areas of operation .
( a ) J@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ able N@@ HE@@ C systems should not be adversely affected when exposed to the electrical field of a minimum of 20 vol@@ ts per me@@ tr@@ e ( i.e. CAT U or equivalent ) radio@@ -@@ frequency ( RF ) field strength per RT@@ CA Document DO-@@ 160 / EU@@ RO@@ CA@@ E ED@@ -14 .
( B ) J@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ able HE@@ C systems should not be adversely affected when exposed to the electrical field of a minimum of 200 vol@@ ts per me@@ tr@@ e ( i.e. CAT Y ) RF field strength per RT@@ CA Document DO-@@ 160 / EU@@ RO@@ CA@@ E ED@@ -14 .
previous model tests and other data from Ro@@ tor@@ craft of similar configurations that have already been substanti@@ ated based on equivalent test conditions may be used to satisfy the ditching requirements .
for operations which do not contain periods of sta@@ b@@ il@@ is@@ ed operation of greater than 30 minutes , alternative procedures need to be incorporated to ensure that the total data set is recorded within a specified number of flying hours related to the minimum adequate frequency of data collec@@ tion determined under AM@@ C 29.@@ 14@@ 65 ( e ) ( 2 ) , and in any case no longer than 25 flying hours .
the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter high-@@ intensity Radiated Fi@@ elds ( HIRF ) safety Assessment should consider the effects on h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter flight safety due to a H@@ IR@@ F-@@ induced failure or malfunction of external load systems , such as an uncommanded hoist winch activation without the ability to j@@ et@@ tis@@ on , or an uncommanded load j@@ et@@ tis@@ on .
where subsystem performance is critical or re@@ lied upon to achieve the qu@@ o@@ ted defect probability of detection or false Alert rate , such as sensor accuracy , dynamic range or band@@ width , then this should be qu@@ o@@ ted .
( 9 ) CS 29.@@ 801 ( e ) requires that after ditching in sea conditions for which certification with ditching provisions is requested by the applicant , the probability of cap@@ si@@ zing in a 5 minute exposure is accep@@ ta@@ bly low in order to allow the occupants to leave the Ro@@ tor@@ craft and enter life rafts .
cri@@ ticality describes the se@@ ver@@ ity of the end result of a V@@ H@@ M application failure / malfunction and is determined by an Assessment that con@@ si@@ ders the safety effect that the V@@ H@@ M application can have on the Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
( 10 ) Providing a wet floor concept ( water in the cabin ) by positioning the flo@@ ats higher on the fuselage sides and allowing the Ro@@ tor@@ craft to float lower in the water , can be a way of increasing the stability of a dit@@ ched Ro@@ tor@@ craft , or it may be desirable for other reasons .
although this would need to be verified for the individual Ro@@ tor@@ craft type for all weight and loading conditions
( a ) Actual service experience on V@@ H@@ M equipped Ro@@ tor@@ craft of the same or of similar type and configuration , including information from module strips , component remo@@ vals , inspections and other investig@@ ations which is relevant to the review of V@@ H@@ M system performance .
experience has shown that in water impact events , the forces exerted on the emergency flo@@ tation unit that first comes into contact with the water surface , together with structural deformation and other damage , can ren@@ der the unit unusable .
this is permissible provided that the mean static level of water in the cabin is limited to being lower than the upper surface of the seat cushion ( for all Ro@@ tor@@ craft mass and cen@@ tr@@ e of gravity cases , with all flo@@ tation units intact ) , and that the presence of water will not un@@ du@@ ly restrict the ability of occupants to evacuate the Ro@@ tor@@ craft and enter the life raft .
when recogn@@ is@@ ed good practices for such installation are applied , an analysis may be sufficient to highlight that the maximum possible pulse generated into the squib circuit will have an energy content or@@ ders of magnitude below the squib no-@@ fire energy .
that is , the Ro@@ tor@@ craft manufacturer shows compliance with the flo@@ tation time , stability , and emergency exit requirements while a mo@@ di@@ fier shows compliance with the equipment and e@@ gre@@ ss requirements with the interior completed .
one acceptable test method to demon@@ st@@ rate the adequ@@ ac@@ y of Q@@ RS shielding , bonding , and grounding would be to actuate the hoist under maximum load , together with likely critical combinations of other aircraft electrical loads , and demon@@ st@@ rate that the test squibs ( which are more EMI sensitive than the squibs specified for use in the Q@@ RS ) do not in@@ ad@@ ver@@ ten@@ tly operate during the test .
in performing this Assessment it will be necessary to consider the possibility of d@@ or@@ m@@ ant and common mode failures and the possibility of the V@@ H@@ M system introduc@@ ing additional risks , e.g. due to the false Alarm rate .
where a V@@ H@@ M application is not necessary for compliance with CS 29.@@ 5@@ 47 ( b ) and / or CS 29.@@ 9@@ 17 ( b ) , the failure effect of these functions is considered to be No Safety Effect when there have been no changes to the traditional techniques .
the analysis of the environmental factors as a means of compliance is necessary , but not sufficient , for new control types or tech@@ no@@ log@@ ies , or for no@@ vel use of the controls that are themselves not new or no@@ vel .
The applicant should show that the controls required to re@@ gain control of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft or system and the controls required to continue operating the Ro@@ tor@@ craft in a safe manner are usable in conditions with extreme lighting conditions and severe vibration levels and should not prevent the crew members from performing all their tasks with an acceptable level of performance and workload .
When an on-@@ board V@@ H@@ M system is used to replace existing portable test equipment , and is performing an identical function , ( though not nec@@ ess@@ arily utili@@ sing the same method of detection ) , this can be classified as No Safety Effect , providing that in such cases there will be no reduction in scheduled component inspection , or extension of overhaul or replacement intervals .
if the hook is used as a quick-release device , then the release of critical loads should be demonstrated under conditions that simulate the maximum allowable bank angles and speeds and any other critical operating conditions .
( I ) To ensure that a control is un@@ amb@@ ig@@ u@@ ous per CS 29.@@ 13@@ 02 ( b ) ( 1 ) , the relationship and inte@@ raction between a control and its associated display or indications should be readily apparent , under@@ stand@@ able , and logical .
experience has shown that , under certain conditions , a load may in@@ ad@@ ver@@ ten@@ tly hang up because of improper geometry at the hoo@@ k@@ -to-@@ eye interface that will not allow the eye to slide off an open hook as intended .
for example , the applicant should specifically assess any rotary knob that has no obvious increase or &@@ a@@ po@@ s@@ ; decrease function with reg@@ ard to the crew members exp@@ ec@@ tations and its consisten@@ cy with the other controls in the cockpit .
a level of system integrity related to Minor cri@@ ticality supports the reduction or E@@ limin@@ ation of check flights after standard vibration reduction checks and / or adjustments ( rotor track and balance , balancing , absorber tuning , etc . ) .
for both N@@ HE@@ C and HE@@ C designs , the phenomenon of hook dynamic rol@@ l-@@ out ( inadvertent opening of the hook latch and subsequent release of the load ) should be considered to assure that Q@@ RS reliability g@@ o@@ als are not comp@@ ro@@ mi@@ sed .
( IV ) When a valid@@ ated on-@@ board V@@ H@@ M system is used to replace an existing maintenance task , this can be considered to be minor if the valid@@ ated detection capability and integrity is better than the maintenance task being replaced .
hook dynamic rol@@ l-@@ out typically occurs when either the R@@ L@@ C sling or harness is not properly attached to the hook , is blown by down draft , is dra@@ gged along the ground or through water , or is otherwise placed into a dangerous hoo@@ k@@ -to-@@ eye configuration .
( III ) The inflation system should be shown to have an appropriately low probability of spon@@ tan@@ eous or inadvertent actuation in flight conditions for which float deployment has not been demonstrated to be safe .
for use of EU@@ RO@@ CA@@ E ED@@ -@@ 12@@ C / RT@@ CA DO-@@ 17@@ 8@@ C level D software , it will be necessary to carry out periodic functional verification of the V@@ H@@ M system for d@@ or@@ m@@ ant hardware or software failure or following a hardware or software change .
locating controls immediately below a display is generally pref@@ erable , as mounting controls immediately above a display has , in many cases , caused the crew member hand to ob@@ sc@@ ure their view of the display when operating the controls .
the cho@@ ice of input parameters , and architecture of the system , should such that re@@ arming of the system occurs automatically in a manner that will assure the inflation system functions as intended in the event of a water impact .
for cargo hook systems with more than two hooks , either a single release point should be present in the load path between the Ro@@ tor@@ craft and the multiple hook system , or multiple P@@ Q@@ RS@@ s and B@@ Q@@ RS@@ s should be present .
in a dual hook system , if the hook itself is the quick-release device ( i.e. if a single release point does not exist in the load path between the Ro@@ tor@@ craft and the dual hooks ) , the pilot should have a dual P@@ Q@@ RS that includes selectable , co-located individual quick releases that are independent for each hook used .
( 1 ) Guidance for the interpre@@ tation of the Diag@@ no@@ stic information produced by the V@@ H@@ M system for all components monitored , to include Alert and Alarm management , a description of the indicators , and Alert generation methods .
this is the case with a control of a system that is located with other controls for that same system , or when it is one of several controls on a panel dedicated to controls for that multi@@ function display .
( 2 ) Maintenance instructions defin@@ ing the actions to be taken in the event of all al@@ arms , including the appropriate Ro@@ tor@@ craft inspections ( or other maintenance ) necessary for fa@@ ul@@ t-@@ finding to verify the Alarm .
for example , a simple cargo hook should have a one-way , sp@@ ring-@@ loaded gate ( i.e. snap hook ) that allows load attachment going into the gate but does not allow the gate to open ( and subsequently lose the HE@@ C ) when an opera@@ tionally induced load is applied in the opposite direction .
( V ) Activ@@ ation of the emergency flo@@ tation system upon water entry ( ir@@ respective of whether or not inflation prior to water entry is the intended operation mode ) should result in an inflation time short enough to prevent the Ro@@ tor@@ craft from beco@@ ming excessively sub@@ mer@@ ged .
when there is a large sp@@ atial separation between a control and its associated display , the applicant should show that the use of the control for the associated task ( s ) is acceptable in accordance with 29.@@ 7@@ 77 ( a ) and 29.@@ 13@@ 02 .
( IV ) The maximum air@@ speeds for inten@@ tional in-flight actuation of the emergency flo@@ tation system and for flight with the flo@@ ats inflated should be established as limitations in the RFM unless in-flight actuation is prohibited by the RFM .
the release of the load by a dedicated switch at the pilot controls , through the secondary hook on a long line , presents additional risks due to the possibility of the long line impacting the tail or the main rotor after a release , due to its elasticity .
if the range of movement of a control temporarily blocks the crew members view of information , the applicant should show that this information is either not necessary at that time or is available in another accessible location ( CS 29.@@ 13@@ 02 ( b ) ( 2 ) requires the information intended for use by the crew members to be accessible and U@@ SE@@ ABLE by the crew members in a manner appropriate to the ur@@ gency , frequency , and duration of the crew members tasks ) .
( C ) The RFM or R@@ FMS includes a description of the new control in the cockpit , and its function and an RFM or R@@ FMS note to the pilot is included , indicating that the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter hook emergency release procedures are fully applicable ;
if display labels are not identical to those on the related controls , the applicant should show that crew members can quickly , easily , and accurately identify the associated controls so they can safely perform all the tasks associated with the intended function of the systems and equipment ( 29.@@ 13@@ 02 ) .
( 2 ) To meet the objec@@ tives of CS 29.@@ 13@@ 02 , the applicant should show that feedback in all forms is obvious and un@@ amb@@ ig@@ u@@ ous to the crew members when performing their tasks associated with the intended function of the equipment .
( 6 ) Installation of a long line that is provided with electrical wiring to control the hook will generally represent a new electromagnetic coupling path from the external area to the internal systems that may not have been considered for type certification .
as such , the impact of this installation on the coupling to h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter systems , due to direct connection or cross talk to wiring , should be add@@ ressed as part of compliance with CS 29.@@ 610 , 29.@@ 13@@ 16 and 29.@@ 13@@ 17 .
( ix ) The inflation system design should , where prac@@ ti@@ cable , minim@@ i@@ se the possibility of fore@@ se@@ eable damage preventing the operation or partial operation of the EF@@ S ( e.g. inter@@ ru@@ ption of the electrical supply or pi@@ pe@@ work ) .
either the cable should be posi@@ tively attached to the hoist drum and this attachment should have ultimate load capability or an equivalent means should be provided to minim@@ i@@ se the possibility of inadvertent , complete cable un@@ spo@@ ol@@ ing .
this may be accomplished by interconnecting inflation gas sources , for which flexible hoses should be used to minim@@ i@@ se potential damage , or by synchron@@ is@@ ing the deployment of aut@@ ono@@ mo@@ us flo@@ tation units .
( 3 ) Use of the V@@ H@@ M System during Line maintenance to monitor the Ro@@ tor@@ craft , including the data transfer , interface with data analysis , response to alerts and Alarm processing , Ro@@ tor@@ craft fa@@ ul@@ t-@@ finding and other Line Diag@@ no@@ stic actions .
( IV ) when a control is used to move an actuator through its range of travel , the equipment should provide , if needed ( for example , fly-by-wire system ) , within the time required for the relevant task , opera@@ tionally significant feedback of the actuator position within its range .
( 4 ) Necessary system ad@@ ministration functions , covering operational procedures relating to data transfer and storage , recovery from failed down loads and the introduction of hardware and software modifications .
as an example , the switch position alone is insufficient feedback if awareness of the actual system response or the state of the system as a result of an action is required in accordance with CS 29.@@ 13@@ 02 ( b ) ( 3 ) .
the user inte@@ rac@@ ting with a graphical control should receive a positive indication that a hi@@ era@@ r@@ ch@@ ical menu item has been selected , a graphical button has been activated , or another input has been accepted .
for example , ICAO Do@@ c 8@@ 400 Procedures for Air Navigation Serv@@ ices ( pan@@ s ) - ICAO Abbreviations and Codes provides abbreviations , and is one standard that could be applied to the tex@@ tual material used in the cockpit .
( 3 ) App@@ lic@@ ants should give careful attention to symbol priority ( the priority of displaying one symbol over@@ lay@@ ing another symbol by ed@@ iting out the secondary symbol ) to ensure that high@@ er-@@ priority symbols remain vie@@ wa@@ ble .
CS 29.@@ 13@@ 02 requires the information intended for use by the crew members to be provided in a clear and un@@ amb@@ ig@@ u@@ ous format in a resolution and precision appropriate to the task , and the information to conve@@ y the intended mean@@ ing .
( I ) Information intended for the crew members must be accessible and U@@ SE@@ ABLE by the crew members in a manner appropriate to the ur@@ gency , frequency , and duration of their tasks , as per CS 29.@@ 13@@ 02 ( b ) ( 2 ) .
if the equipment uses automatic de@@ selection of data to enhance the crew member performance in certain emergency conditions , the applicant must show , as per CS 29.@@ 13@@ 02 ( a ) , that it provides the information the crew member needs .
( III ) Because of the transient n@@ ature of the au@@ dit@@ ory information presen@@ tation , design@@ ers should be careful to avoid the potential for comp@@ e@@ ting au@@ dit@@ ory presen@@ tations that may conflict with each other and hinder their interpre@@ tation .
the applicant should show that the response to a control input , such as setting values , displaying parameters , or moving a cursor symbol on a graphical display , is fast enough to allow the crew members to complete the task at an acceptable level of performance .
( 2 ) The requirement for opera@@ tionally relevant system be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our to be predic@@ table and un@@ amb@@ ig@@ u@@ ous will enable the crew members to know what the system is doing and what they did to enable / disable the be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our .
( 1 ) CS 29.@@ 13@@ 02 ( c ) states that the installed equipment must be designed so that the be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our of the equipment that is opera@@ tionally relevant to the crew members tasks is : ( 1 ) predic@@ table and un@@ amb@@ ig@@ u@@ ous , and ( 2 ) designed to enable the crew members to inter@@ ven@@ e in a manner appropriate to the task ( and intended function ) .
( 3 ) If crew member inter@@ ven@@ tion is part of the intended function , or part of the abnormal / malfunction or emergency procedures for the system , the crew member may need to take some action , or change an input to the system .
( 4 ) Improved tech@@ no@@ log@@ ies , which have increased safety and performance , have also intro@@ duced the need to ensure proper co@@ operation between the crew members and the integrated , complex information and control systems .
( II ) the user interface , which consists of the controls that communicate the crew members inputs to the system , and the information that provides feedback to the crew members on the be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our of the system .
( 1 ) the crew members are able to perform all the tasks allo@@ ca@@ ted to them , considering normal , abnormal / malfunction and emergency operating conditions , within the bo@@ unds of an acceptable workload and without requiring un@@ due concentration or causing un@@ due fatigue ( see CS 29.@@ 15@@ 23 and 29.@@ 7@@ 71 ( a ) for workload Assessment ) ;
for example , a mode engagement or arming selection by the crew members should result in annunciation , indication or display feedback that is adequate to provide awareness of the effect of their action .
additionally , any change in the mode as a result of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft changing from one operational mode ( for in@@ st@@ ance , on an approach ) to another should be clearly and un@@ amb@@ ig@@ u@@ ously annunciated and fed back to the crew members .
for example , the control action necessary to arm , engage , disarm or disengage a mode should not depend on the mode that is currently armed or engaged , on the setting of one or more other controls , or on the state or status of that or another system .
( D ) uncommanded mode changes and rever@@ sions should have sufficient annunciation , indication , or display information to provide awareness of any uncommanded changes of the engaged or armed mode of a system .
( I ) App@@ lic@@ ants should pro@@ po@@ se the means that they will use to show that the be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our of the systems in the proposed design allows the crew members to inter@@ ven@@ e in the operation of the systems without comp@@ ro@@ mi@@ sing safety .
precautions should also be taken to avoid flo@@ ats being punc@@ tured due to the proximity of sharp objects , during inflation in flight and with the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter in the water , and during subsequent movement of the h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter in waves .
in the case of infla@@ table flo@@ tation units , ir@@ respective of whether the intended operation is to deploy the system before or after water entry , the following shall be taken into account when ass@@ ess@@ ing the ability of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft to remain af@@ lo@@ at ;
- Fol@@ lo@@ wing the functional loss of a deployed flo@@ tation unit , the capability to maintain pressure in the remaining inflation units should be j@@ us@@ tified on the basis of the inflation system design , for example :
- Fol@@ lo@@ wing the functional loss of a non-@@ deployed flo@@ tation unit , the capability of the remaining flo@@ tation units to deploy should be j@@ us@@ tified on the basis of the inflation system design , for example :
o The functionality of the inflation gas sources integrated with the functionally lost flo@@ tation unit in question should also either be assumed to be lost , or j@@ us@@ tification should otherwise be provided ,
o The degree of inflation of the remaining undamaged flo@@ tation units , which share parts of the inflation system with the damaged unit , bearing in min@@ d that the damaged unit will be venting , should be determined .
( 5 ) Suff@@ icient histor@@ ical V@@ H@@ M data is retained and col@@ lated to facilitate the identification of trends on in-service components , the ch@@ ara@@ c@@ teri@@ s@@ ation of Ro@@ tor@@ craft fleet be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our , and V@@ H@@ M performance Assessment .
these tests / simula@@ tions should include determination of the optimum pitch attitude and forward velocity for ditching in a calm sea as well as entry procedures for the most severe sea condition to be certified .
( I ) The Ro@@ tor@@ craft contacts the most severe sea conditions for which certification with ditching or emergency flo@@ tation provisions is requested by the applicant , selected in accordance with Table 1 of AM@@ C to CS 29.@@ 801 ( e ) and 29.@@ 802 ( c ) and as illustrated in Figure 1 a ) . 
these conditions may be simulated considering the Ro@@ tor@@ craft contacting a plane of stationary water as illustrated in Figure 1 b ) , inclined with a range of ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness from zero to the significant ste@@ e@@ p@@ ness given by Ss = 2@@ π@@ H@@ s / ( g@@ T@@ z ) . 
values of Ss are given in Table 1 of AM@@ C to 29.@@ 801 ( e ) and 29.@@ 802 ( c ) .
( E ) sea conditions may be represented by regular waves having a height at least equal to the significant wave height ( HS ) , and a period no larger than the wave zero-@@ crossing period ( T@@ z ) for the wave spectrum cho@@ s@@ en for demon@@ stration of Ro@@ tor@@ craft flo@@ tation stability after water entry ( see ( c ) ( 7 ) below and AM@@ C to CS 29.@@ 801 ( e ) and 29.@@ 802 ( c ) ) ;
Note : if the V@@ H@@ M data is subject to close monitoring due to an increased li@@ k@@ eli@@ hood of a developing mechanical problem , the maximum alle@@ vi@@ ation of 25 hours provided by the MMEL should be reduced or removed .
alternatively , if scale model test data for a h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter of a similar configuration has been previously successfully used to j@@ us@@ tify water entry be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our , this data could form the basis for a compara@@ tive analy@@ tical approach .
( 1 ) When a V@@ H@@ M system initially enters into service or it is adap@@ ted to a new application on a different Ro@@ tor@@ craft type , then a Controlled Service Introduction ( C@@ S@@ I ) phase is usually necessary in order to fully valid@@ ate the system performance .
( 2 ) If a C@@ S@@ I phase is considered to be necessary , then this activity should be detailed in a C@@ S@@ I plan to be approved prior to release to service , de@@ tail@@ ing the V@@ H@@ M applications being developed and the criteria for the successful completion of the C@@ S@@ I .
for configurations which are considered to have critical occu@@ p@@ ant e@@ gre@@ ss capabilities due to the life raft locations or the ditching emergency exit locations and the proximity of the float ( or a combination of both ) , an actual demon@@ stration of e@@ gre@@ ss may be required .
service experience has shown that it is possible for occupants to have esca@@ ped from the cabin , but to have not been able to board a life raft and to have had difficulty in finding hand@@ holds to stay af@@ lo@@ at and together .
the Ro@@ tor@@ craft design is to be tested , at each mass condition ( see paragraph b ( 1 ) ( II ) below ) , with its flo@@ tation system intact , and with its single most critical flo@@ tation compartment damaged ( i.e. the single-@@ puncture case which has the worst adverse effect on flo@@ tation stability ) .
C@@ S-@@ 29 A@@ men@@ d@@ ment 5 intro@@ duced the need to mark emergency controls for use following a ditching or water impact with black and yellow stripes , instead of red , to make them more con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous when viewed underwater .
( 1 ) Any emergency control that may be required to be operated underwater ( e.g. an emergency flo@@ tation system deployment switch , a life raft deployment switch or handle ) should be co@@ lo@@ ured with black and yellow stripes .
( 2 ) Lock@@ ers , compartments , or po@@ u@@ ches used to contain safety equipment such as life pre@@ ser@@ vers , etc . , should be marked to identify the equipment the@@ re@@ in and to also identify , if not obvious , the method or means of acce@@ ssing or releasing the equipment .
( 5 ) As prescribed , each life raft and its installed equipment should be provided with clear operating instruction markings that cannot be easily era@@ sed or dis@@ figu@@ red and are read@@ able at low levels of illumination .
( 6 ) Ea@@ si@@ ly recogn@@ is@@ ed or identified and easily accessible safety equipment located in sight of the occupants , such as a passenger compartment fire extinguisher that all passengers can see , may not require locating signs , sten@@ c@@ ils , or decals .
for ditching , the intact flo@@ tation system probability of cap@@ si@@ zing of 3 % is derived from a histor@@ ic ditching rate of 3.@@ 32 x 10-6 per flight hour and an AM@@ C 29.@@ 1309 con@@ sequence of hazardous , which imp@@ lies a frequency of cap@@ si@@ zing of less than 10-@@ 7 per flight hour .
this AM@@ C provides further guidance and acceptable means of compliance to supplement FAA AC 29-@@ 2C Change 4 ( AC 29.@@ 15@@ 83 § 29.@@ 15@@ 83 ( A@@ men@@ d@@ ment 29-@@ 24 ) OPERATING LIMITATIONS ) , to meet the A@@ gency interpre@@ tation of CS 29.@@ 15@@ 83 .
in simple designs , rounded corners and edges with adequate STRAPPING ( or other means of HE@@ C retention relative to the complex P@@ CD@@ S ) and head supports or pads may be all the safety features that are necessary .
this section should contain the following pre@@ am@@ ble : this Ro@@ tor@@ craft is certified in the Large Category ( category B or category A and category B ) and is el@@ ig@@ ible for the following kinds of operations when the appropriate instruments and equipment required by the airworthiness and operating rules are installed and approved and are in an operable condition . the following , and any other kinds of operations that are applicable , should be listed .
CS 29.@@ 9@@ 27 ( c ) provides guidance for the completion of testing to simulate a loss of lubrication and on how to demon@@ st@@ rate confidence in the margin of safety associated with the maximum period of operation following loss of lubrication .
if certification with ditching provisions is obtained in a se@@ g@@ mented fa@@ shi@@ on ( i.e. one applicant performing the safety equipment installation and operations portion and another de@@ sig@@ ning and substanti@@ ating the safety equipment performance and deployment facilities ) , the RFM limitations should state that the ditching provisions are not approved until all the segments are completed .
there should be clear instructions to describe when the complex P@@ CD@@ S is no longer serviceable and should be replaced in part or as a whole due to wear , impact damage , fraying of fi@@ b@@ res , or other forms of degradation .
if extended testing was performed in accordance with the AM@@ C to 29.@@ 801 ( e ) and 29.@@ 802 ( c ) to demon@@ st@@ rate that the target level of cap@@ size probability can be reached without any operational limitations , this should also be sta@@ ted .
acceptable means of establi@@ shing the sus@@ ce@@ p@@ tibility of Ro@@ tor@@ craft features to the effects of volcanic clouds should include a combination of experience , stu@@ dies , analysis , and / or testing of parts or sub@@ - assemblies .
information necessary for safe operation should be contained in the un@@ approved part of the flight manual or other appropriate manual , and should be readily usable by operators in preparing a safety risk Assessment as part of their overall management system .
complex PC@@ DS@@ s should be designed to the maximum prac@@ ti@@ cable extent and placarded to ma@@ xim@@ i@@ se the HE@@ C protection from medical considerations such as blocked air pass@@ ages induced by improper body configurations and excessive losses of body heat during operations .
( E ) The related pre-@@ flight , in-flight and post-@@ flight precautions to be taken by the operator including any necessary am@@ en@@ d@@ ments to Aircraft Operating Manu@@ als , Aircraft Maintenance Manu@@ als , Master Minimum Equipment List / Dispatch Deviation or Equi@@ val@@ ents , required to support the operator .
( F ) The recommended continu@@ ing-@@ airworthiness inspections associated with operations in airspace contaminated by volcanic cloud ( s ) and ar@@ riv@@ ing to or de@@ parting from aero@@ dro@@ mes contaminated by volcanic ash ;
( 4 ) When demon@@ stra@@ ting compliance , the applicant should consider the crew members tasks in all operating conditions , considering that many of the same design characteristics are relevant in each case .
App@@ lic@@ ants should submit test reports showing that the la@@ bo@@ ra@@ tor@@ y-@@ tested categories , such as temperature , vibration , altitude , etc . , are compatible with the environmental dem@@ ands placed on the Ro@@ tor@@ craft .
this can be achieved by determining the specific local environmental conditions in which the equipment will be installed and establi@@ shing the compa@@ tibility with the required DO-@@ 160 environmental condition .
when CS 27.@@ 1@@ 141 ( e ) was established regarding a no single failure or malfunction in any power@@ plant control system which may cause the failure of any power@@ plant function necessary for safety , this was based on FA@@ R 23-@@ 1@@ 141 as revised at A@@ men@@ d@@ ment ( 23-@@ 7 ) .
( I ) sta@@ tement of si@@ mil@@ arity ( paragraph 5.3 ) : a sta@@ tement of si@@ mil@@ arity may be used to substanti@@ ate that the design has sufficient certification prece@@ dent to con@@ clu@@ de that the ability of the crew members to manage errors has not significantly changed .
for the case of an intact flo@@ tation system , if the nor@@ ther@@ n North Sea default wave climate has been cho@@ s@@ en for certification , the Ro@@ tor@@ craft should be shown to resist cap@@ size in a sea condition selected from Table 1 .
the probability of cap@@ si@@ zing in a 5-minute exposure to the selected sea condition is to be demonstrated to be less than or equal to the value provided in CS 29.@@ 801 ( e ) or 29.@@ 802 ( c ) , as appropriate , with a confidence of 95 % or greater .
it should be shown that , in any practical circumstances , movement of the pilot ground control ( including movement during retraction or extension or after retraction of the landing gear ) cannot interfere with the correct retraction or extension of the landing gear , unless it can be shown that such interference cannot create a con@@ sequence wor@@ se than Major , as defined in V@@ TO@@ L@@ .25@@ 10 .
the Ro@@ tor@@ craft model , including its emergency flo@@ tation , is to be con@@ structed to be geo@@ me@@ trically similar to the full-@@ scale Ro@@ tor@@ craft design at a scale that will permit the required wave conditions to be accurately represented in the model basin .
in addition to meeting 29.@@ 901 ( c ) , a failure analysis must be performed for each pressurized gearbox lubrication system which will , as a minimum , establish any single failures and likely common cause failures which could lead to rapid loss of oil and con@@ sequ@@ ent in@@ ability to continue safe flight or safe landing .
where it is likely that water may flood into the internal spaces following an emergency landing on water , for example through doors opened to permit escape , or any other opening , the model should represent these internal spaces and openings as real@@ is@@ tically as possible .
an inter@@ communications system may also be approved as part of the external load system , or alternatively , a limitation may be placed in the RFM or R@@ FMS as described under paragraph c . ( 4 ) ( II ) ( B ) ( 2 ) of this AM@@ C .
( 11 ) CS 29.@@ 86@@ 5 ( c ) ( 4 ) inter@@ com Systems for HE@@ C Operations : for all HE@@ C operations , the Ro@@ tor@@ craft is required to be equipped for , or otherwise allow , direct intercommunication under any operational conditions among crew members and the HE@@ C .
( 12 ) CS 29.@@ 86@@ 5 ( c ) ( 6 ) Limitations for HE@@ C Operations : for j@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ able HE@@ C operations , a Ro@@ tor@@ craft may be required by operations requirements to meet the Category A engine isolation requirements of C@@ S-@@ 29 and to have one-@@ engine-@@ inoperative / out-of-@@ ground effect ( O@@ E@@ I / O@@ GE ) ho@@ ver performance capability in its approved , j@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ able HE@@ C weight , altitude , and temperature envelope .
( C ) An error that is detectable by the system should provide an alert and provide sufficient information that a crew member error has occurred , such as in the case of a take-off configuration warning .
3 In general the model cannot be permitted to float freely in the basin because in the nec@@ ess@@ arily long wave test du@@ rations , the model would otherwise drift down the basin and out of the calibrated wave region .
this limitation should limit IFR coupled R@@ NAV approach operations to an appropriate and j@@ us@@ ti@@ fi@@ ably con@@ serv@@ ative glide path angle and the minimum approach airspeed that meet flight manual limitations .
the model test facility is to have the capability to generate real@@ is@@ tic long non-@@ rep@@ eating sequ@@ ences of unidirectional ( long-@@ cre@@ sted ) irregular waves , as well as the characteristic wave condition at the cho@@ s@@ en model scale .
for guidance on EAS@@ A procedures , reference should be made to Com@@ mission Regulation ( EC ) No 17@@ 02 / 200@@ 3 ( as am@@ ended ) ( P@@ art@@ -@@ 21 ) , AM@@ C-@@ 20 ( and specifically AM@@ C 20@@ -1 and 20-@@ 3 ) and to EAS@@ A Internal working procedures ,
Certification procedures identified in MG@@ 5 refer specifically to the FAA regulatory system and are not fully applicable to the EAS@@ A regulatory system due to the different applicability of restricted certification .
when ho@@ vering O@@ GE or IG@@ E at the maximum O@@ E@@ I ho@@ ver weight , an engine failure should not result in an altitude loss of more than 10 per c@@ ent or 4 feet , whichever is greater , of the altitude established at the time of engine failure .
the certification basis of design changes or supplemental Type certific@@ ates for ag@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ tu@@ ral disp@@ en@@ s@@ ing is to be established in accordance with 2@@ 1.@@ A@@ .@@ 101 of An@@ ne@@ x I to Regulation ( E@@ U ) No 7@@ 48 / 2012 , on a ca@@ se-@@ by-@@ case basis through compliance with the applicable airworthiness requirements contained in MG@@ 5 , supplemented by any special conditions in accordance with 2@@ 1.@@ A@@ .@@ 16@@ B of Regulation ( E@@ U ) No 7@@ 48 / 2012 that are appropriate to the application and specific operating limitations and conditions .
the model is to be installed in the wave facility in a location sufficiently dist@@ ant from the wave maker , tank walls and be@@ ach / absorber such that the wave conditions are rep@@ e@@ at@@ able and not influ@@ enced by the bo@@ und@@ ar@@ ies .

( III ) Calculation and engineering analysis ( paragraph 5.3 ) : as one possible means of demon@@ stra@@ ting compliance with CS 29.@@ 13@@ 02 ( d ) , an applicant may document the means of error management through the analysis of controls , indications , system be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our , and related crew member tasks .
based on E@@ U le@@ g@@ is@@ lation@@ 8 , in new installations of hand fire extinguishers for which the certification application is submitted after 31 Dec@@ emb@@ er 20@@ 14 , Halon 1211 , 1301 and Halon 2402 are unacceptable extinguishing agents .
for example , for a h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter that su@@ stains an engine failure at a height of 40 feet , the time required to re-@@ sta@@ b@@ il@@ i@@ se in a ho@@ ver , recover the external load ( given the hoist speed limitations ) , and then transition to forward flight ( with minim@@ al altitude loss ) would likely preclude the use of the 30-@@ second engine ratings and may en@@ cro@@ ach upon the 2 ? -@@ minute ratings .
( IV ) The Ro@@ tor@@ craft flight manual ( RFM ) should contain information that describes the expected altitude loss , any special recovery techniques , and the time increment used for recovery of the external load when establi@@ shing maximum weights and wheel or skid heights .
this AM@@ C provides further guidance and acceptable means of compliance to supplement the FAA AC 29-@@ 2C Change 7 mg 6 , which is the EAS@@ A acceptable means of compliance , as provided for in AM@@ C 29 General .
( 6 ) As discussed further in paragraph 5 , these evalu@@ ations or tests should use appropriate sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os that reflec@@ t the intended functions and tasks , including the use of the equipment in normal , abnormal / malfunction and emergency conditions .
maximum two-@@ engine generator loads should be established so that when one engine or generator fails , the remaining generator can assume the entire Ro@@ tor@@ craft electrical load ( including the maximum hoist electrical load ) without exceeding the approved limitations .
( 14 ) CS 29.@@ 86@@ 5 ( e ) External Loads Placards and Markings : Placards and markings should be installed next to the ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al-@@ load attaching means , in a clearly no@@ tic@@ eable location , that state the primary operational limitations - specifically including the maximum author@@ is@@ ed external load .
any equipment not essential to the safe operation of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft may be approved provided the use , operation , and possible failure modes of the equipment are not hazardous to the Ro@@ tor@@ craft Safe flight , safe landing , and prompt evacuation of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft , in the event of a minor crash landing , for any reason , are the objec@@ tives of the EAS@@ A evaluation of interi@@ ors and equipment unique to E@@ MS .
( I ) A@@ g@@ r@@ ic@@ ul@@ tu@@ ral Installations ( AI@@ s ) : AI@@ s can be approved for either j@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ able or non-@@ j@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ able N@@ HE@@ C or HE@@ C operations as long as they meet relevant certification and operations requirements and follow appropriate compliance methods .
( B ) verify that the wave spectrum does not deterio@@ rate app@@ rec@@ i@@ ably during the run in order to help establish the maximum duration test that can be run before the test facility must be allowed to become calm again .
the length of the basin covered by this range will be the permitted test region for the free@@ -@@ floating model , and the model will be recovered when it dri@@ fts outside this region ( See paragraph 4 below ) .
if a free@@ -@@ floating model is to be used , then the waves are to be calibrated for a range of locations down the basin , and the spectrum measured in each of these locations should be shown to be the same .
for example , a Ro@@ tor@@ craft equipped only for transportation of a non-@@ amb@@ ula@@ tory person ( e.g. a pol@@ ice Ro@@ tor@@ craft with one lit@@ ter ) as well as a Ro@@ tor@@ craft equipped with multiple lit@@ ters and complete life support systems and two or more attendants or medical personnel may be submitted for approval .
App@@ lic@@ ants should show that this information is available to the crew members , is adequately detectable , and it shows a clear relationship between the crew member action and the error so a recovery can be made in a timely manner .
this is not considered to be a true j@@ et@@ tis@@ on capability ( see definition ) since the external load is not released by a Q@@ RS and since the release time span is typically greater than 30 seconds ( re@@ f . : B ( 20 ) and c ( 7 ) ) .
large category Ro@@ tor@@ craft should comply with flight crew and passenger safety standards , which will result in the need to re-@@ evaluate certain features of the baseline existing type certified Ro@@ tor@@ craft related to the E@@ MS arrangement , such as doors and emergency exits , and occu@@ p@@ ant protection .
other locations for the information may be appropriate depending on the crew tasks and the impor@@ tance of the information , such as on the control display unit when the task involves de@@ al@@ ing with a flight plan .
however , other designs that have the entire AI ( or significant portions there@@ of ) attached to the Ro@@ tor@@ craft , that have short time frame j@@ et@@ tis@@ on ( or release ) capabilities provided by Q@@ RS@@ s that meet the definitions herein and that have no post-@@ j@@ et@@ tis@@ on characteristics that would en@@ danger continued safe flight and landing may be approved as j@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ able external loads .
compliance with airworthiness standards results in the following features that should be retained as part of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft baseline type design : an emergency interior lighting system , placards or markings for doors and exits , exit size , exit quantity and location , exit access , safety belts and possibly shoulder harnesses or other restraint or passenger protection means .
the features , placards , markings , and emergency systems required as part of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft baseline type design should be retained unless specific replacements or alternate designs are necessary for the E@@ MS configuration to comply with airworthiness standards .
if an external tank is to be j@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ ed in flight , it should have a Q@@ RS that is approved for the maximum j@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ able external tank payload and is either in@@ operable or is otherwise ren@@ dered reliable to minim@@ i@@ se inadvertent j@@ et@@ tis@@ ons above the maximum j@@ et@@ tis@@ on@@ able external tank payload .
it is recommended that load-@@ measuring devices ( such as load cells ) be used to assure that no un@@ recorded over@@ loads occur and to assure that cycles producing high fatigue damage are properly considered .
if , on the other hand , additional information is available that would allow the crew to identify and correct the error , then the alert , in combination with the additional information , would be sufficient to comply with CS 29.@@ 13@@ 02 ( d ) for that error .
this method is only permitted if the change in significant wave height and period is sufficiently small that the same sequence of cap@@ si@@ zing waves , al@@ be@@ it at a lower amplitude , can be seen in the wave basin .
on the other hand , an alert about the system state resulting from accidentally shutting down a hydraulic pump , for example , may not provide sufficient information to the crew members to enable them to distinguish an error from a system fault .
( 3 ) All h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter air am@@ bul@@ ance service provi@@ ders are required to operate at all times in accordance with Regulation ( E@@ U ) No 9@@ 65 / 2012 , which also defin@@ es the equipment required for an operational approval to be obtained .
if it is dec@@ i@@ ded to modify the model flo@@ tation with the inten@@ tion of demon@@ stra@@ ting that the modified model does not cap@@ size in the wave condition , then the p@@ se@@ u@@ d@@ or@@ an@@ dom wave maker time series should be re@@ started at a point at least 5 minutes prior to the cap@@ size event so that the model is seen to survi@@ ve the wave that caused a cap@@ size prior to the modification .
( a ) the applicable Direc@@ tive 89 / 68@@ 6 / E@@ EC or Regulation ( E@@ U ) 20@@ 16 / 425 , as applicable , or subsequent revision and corresponding en standards for the respective components are comp@@ lied with ( EC Type Ex@@ amination Certificate ) ;
provided that the same basic p@@ se@@ u@@ d@@ or@@ an@@ dom wave time series can be re@@ produced by the wave basin at a lower wave height and corresponding period , it is permitted to restart the wave maker time series at a point at least 5 minutes prior to the cap@@ size event , 
and if the model is now seen to survi@@ ve the wave sequence that caused a cap@@ size in the more severe condition , then cre@@ di@@ t can then be taken for the run duration successfully achieved prior to the cap@@ size .
Note 2 : a simple P@@ CD@@ S has an EC Type Ex@@ amination Certificate ( similar to an ST@@ C ) , issued by a no@@ tified Certification Body and , for the production and mar@@ ke@@ ting , an EC Con@@ form@@ ity Certificate ( similar to an EAS@@ A Form 1 ) issued by the manufacturer .
Note 3 : in cases where ropes or elements connect simple PC@@ DS@@ s to the hoist / cargo hook or internal h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter cabin , the en certification can be achieved by a body meeting the tr@@ an@@ spo@@ si@@ tion into national law of the applicable EC / E@@ U regulation .
the model is to be te@@ m@@ po@@ ra@@ lly restra@@ ined with light lines and then released be@@ am@@ -on to the waves such that the free@@ -@@ floating model is seen to experience the same wave time series that caused a cap@@ size in exactly the same position in the basin .
for example , the attachment of the te@@ thering strap to the harness of a hoist operator should be of a D@@ AD quick-release type to allow quick detach@@ ment from the aircraft following a ditching or emergency landing .
if the free@@ -@@ floating , model having been la@@ un@@ ched be@@ am@@ -on to the waves , is seen to yaw into a more benef@@ ic@@ ial heading once released , and seen to survi@@ ve the wave that caused a cap@@ size in the restra@@ ined model , then this is accepted as ne@@ g@@ ating the cap@@ size seen with the restra@@ ined model .
in the event of an engine asymmetrical thrust linked to crew member error , which manif@@ ested itself in a change in the rpm on one engine , the sp@@ atial misalignment of the needles could assist the pilots in di@@ ag@@ no@@ sing the issue and identifying asymmetrical th@@ ru@@ st-@@ lever position .
if a free@@ -@@ floating model is being used for the tests , then it is accepted that the model will need to be recovered as it leaves the calibrated wave region , and then rela@@ un@@ ched at the top of that region .
( 1 ) When an error or its effects are detected , the next logical step is to ensure that the error can be rever@@ sed , or that the effect of the error can be mi@@ tig@@ ated in some way so that the Ro@@ tor@@ craft is returned to a safe state .
if UL@@ min is above the static strength currently dec@@ la@@ red by the supplier of the P@@ CD@@ S or of a component of the attachments , through compliance with an en standard , then proof of sufficient strength is to be provided by static tests .
( 4 ) The applicant may establish that information is available and clearly related to the error by using a design description when a prece@@ dent exists or when a reasonable case may be made that the content of the information is clearly related to the error that caused it .
if required by the applicable operating rule or if an applicant elec@@ ts to , this AM@@ C provides a means of compliance for the airworthiness certification of a simple person@@ n@@ el-@@ carrying device system ( P@@ CD@@ S ) and attaching means to the hook , providing safety factors and consideration of calendar life replacement limits in lieu of a dedicated fatigue analysis and test .
in all the above cases continu@@ ation runs are to be performed until the total duration of exposure to the wave condition is sufficient to establish that the 5-minute probability of cap@@ si@@ zing has been determined with the required confidence of 95 % .
( I ) controls and indications exist that can be used either to reverse an er@@ ron@@ eous action directly so that the Ro@@ tor@@ craft or system is returned to the original state , or to mi@@ tig@@ ate the effect so that the Ro@@ tor@@ craft or system is returned to a safe state ;
components and details added to the EN@@ -@@ approved equipment ( such as spl@@ icing , knots , stit@@ ching , seams , press fits , etc . ) or the materials used ( tex@@ ti@@ les , composites , etc . ) that might reduce the strength of a product or could ( in combination ) have other de@@ tri@@ mental effects have been investig@@ ated by the applicant and ac@@ coun@@ ted for in the substantiation .
( 3 ) For simple or familiar types of system interfaces , or systems that are not no@@ vel , even if they are complex , a sta@@ tement of si@@ mil@@ arity or a description of the design of the crew member interfaces and the procedures associated with the indications may be an acceptable means of compliance .
given that it has been demonstrated that the wave time series are non-@@ rep@@ eating and sta@@ tis@@ tically random , the results of the tests may be analy@@ sed on the assu@@ mption that each fi@@ ve-@@ minute element of the total time series is independent .
( 4 ) To establish that the crew members can be expected to use those controls and indications to accomplish corrective actions in a timely manner , an Assessment of the crew member procedures in a simulated cockpit environment can be highly effective .
( D ) The effects of age@@ ing ( due to sunlight , temperature , water immersion , etc . ) and other operational factors that may affect the strength of the P@@ CD@@ S are ac@@ coun@@ ted for through appropriate inspections and the application of a calendar life limit as appropriate .
Ass@@ ess@@ ments and / or analy@@ ses may be used to show that , following an error , the crew member has the information in an effective form and has the Ro@@ tor@@ craft capability required for continued safe flight and landing .
if the model Ro@@ tor@@ craft has not cap@@ sized during the total duration of the tests , the confidence that the probability of cap@@ si@@ zing within 5 minutes is less than the target value of P@@ cap@@ size ( target ) , as shown below :
for NV@@ IS approved Ro@@ tor@@ craft , experience has shown that some changes , which are classified as being minor according to the AM@@ C to 2@@ 1.@@ A@@ .@@ 91 for unaided flight , may have an app@@ rec@@ i@@ able effect on the cockpit / cabin lighting characteristics , and thus on crew vision through the NV@@ G@@ s .
Note 6 : the following considerations and corresponding instructions / limitations should be taken for en 14@@ 98 Type A and C rescue loops due to their potential de@@ tri@@ mental ph@@ y@@ si@@ ological effects and the risk falling out :
( I ) In addition to the instruments and equipment required for flight at night , the following additional instruments and equipment will typically be necessary for NVG operations ( to be defined for each h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter ) .
( 2 ) Pi@@ lo@@ ted ass@@ ess@@ ments in the Ro@@ tor@@ craft or in sim@@ ulation may be relevant if crew member performance issues are in question for determining whether a state following an error permits continued safe flight and landing .
for example , generator drive controls on many Ro@@ tor@@ craft have gu@@ ards over the switches to prevent their inadvertent actuation , because once disengaged , the drives cannot be re-@@ engaged while in flight or with the engine running .
an example of confirmation action would be the presen@@ tation of a flight plan modification in a temporary flight plan , where the crew members will activate the flight plan through a confirmation action .
the construction of the model is to be sufficiently light to permit the model to be bal@@ la@@ sted to achieve the desired weight and rotational in@@ er@@ ti@@ as specified in the mass conditions ( see ( b ) ( 1 ) ( II ) below ) 1 .
it is recommended that an applicant carries out a careful evaluation of the radio altimeter hu@@ man@@ -@@ machine interface ( including the presen@@ tation of height and the possibility of selecting the DH ) to establish that it is able to provide the crew with the necessary information .
an example would be a system that removes the flight director bars from a primary flight display or removes the o@@ wn@@ -@@ ship position from an airport surface map display when the data driving the symbols is incorrect .
the guidance contained within FAA AC 29-@@ 2C Change 7 mg 17 has been dee@@ med by EAS@@ A to be at variance with EAS@@ A interpre@@ tation or its regulatory system and therefore should not be considered to be EAS@@ A acceptable means of compliance .
( IV ) Required wave run du@@ rations The total duration of runs required to demon@@ st@@ rate that the required probability of cap@@ si@@ zing has been achieved ( or be@@ t@@ tered ) is dependent on that probability itself , and on the reliability or confidence of the cap@@ size probability required to be demonstrated .
thus , the probability of cap@@ si@@ zing in a 5-minute exposure to the sea condition is to be demonstrated to be less than or equal to 10 times the required probability for the intact flo@@ tation system case , with a confidence of 95 % or greater .
in this case , the probability of cap@@ si@@ zing in a 5-minute exposure to the sea condition is to be demonstrated to be less than or equal to the required value ( see CS 29.@@ 801 ( e ) or 29.@@ 802 ( c ) ) , with a confidence of 95 % or greater .
with the assu@@ mption that each 5-minute exposure to the wave conditions is independent , the equations provided in ( b ) ( 5 ) below can be used to determine the duration without a cap@@ size that is required to demon@@ st@@ rate the required per@@ for@@ man@@ ce@@ 6 .
integration issues include where a display or control is installed , how it inte@@ rac@@ ts with other systems , and whether there is internal consisten@@ cy across functions within a multi-function display , as well as consisten@@ cy with the rest of the cockpit equipment .
( 1 ) A comp@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ sive report describing the model tests , the facility they were performed in , the model properties , the wave conditions used , the results of the tests , and the method of analysis to demon@@ st@@ rate compliance with CS 29.@@ 801 ( d ) and ( e ) .
( 1 ) App@@ lic@@ ants should show , as per CS 29.@@ 13@@ 02 ( b ) , that display formats include the type of information the crew member needs for the task , specifically with reg@@ ard to the required speed and precision of reading .
it should be noted that , if the Ro@@ tor@@ craft is permitted to fly over sea conditions with significant wave heights above the certification limit , then P@@ cap@@ size ( target ) should be reduced by the probability of exceedance of the certification limit for the significant wave height ( P@@ e ) ( see Appendix 2 below ) .
( 3 ) improper co@@ lo@@ ur@@ -@@ co@@ ding increases the response times for display item recognition and selection , and increases the li@@ k@@ eli@@ hood of errors , which is particularly true in situations where the speed of performing a task is more important than the accuracy , so the compa@@ tibility of co@@ lo@@ ur@@ s with the background should be verified in all the fore@@ se@@ eable lighting conditions .
if information cannot be presented consistently within the cockpit , the applicant should show that the differences do not increase the error rates or task times , which would lead to a significant reduction in the safety margins or an increase in the crew members workload , and do not cause confusion to crew members .
simple PC@@ DS@@ s that comply with Direc@@ tive 89 / 68@@ 6 / E@@ EC , or Regulation ( E@@ U ) 20@@ 16 / 425 , as applicable , or subsequent revision and the corresponding en standards for the respective components are lab@@ el@@ led by the manufacturer according to the applicable standard .
( 1 ) The following Radio Technical Com@@ mission for A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics ( RT@@ CA ) documents are considered to be guidance for showing compliance with the relevant certification specifications for the installation of automatic flight control guidance and control systems ( AF@@ GCS ) .
however , to enhance off@@ shore h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter safety , some national aviation authorities ( NA@@ As ) have im@@ posed restrictions that prevent normal operations ( i.e. excluding emergencies , search and rescue ( S@@ AR ) , etc . ) over sea conditions that are more severe than those for which performance has been demonstrated .
since it is con@@ serv@@ a@@ tively assumed that the probability of cap@@ si@@ zing in sea conditions that exceed the certified wave height is un@@ ity , the lower cap@@ size probability required to be met is the target value minus the probability of the selected wave height being exceeded .
these operational restrictions may be avoided by ac@@ coun@@ ting for the probability of exposure to sea conditions that exceed the selected wave height by cer@@ tifying the Ro@@ tor@@ craft for a lower probability of cap@@ si@@ zing .
Note : if the person ( s ) or their task requires the personal carriage of heavy items ( back@@ packs , tools , fire extinguishers , etc . ) , these must be ac@@ coun@@ ted for in the total mass M , in addition to the person mass of 100 kg .
however , it should also be noted that , in addition to restricting normal h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter overwater operations to the demonstrated capability , i.e. the applicant cho@@ s@@ en significant wave height limit ( HS ( limit ) ) , an NA@@ A may dec@@ l@@ are a maximum limit above which all operations will be suspended due to the difficulty of rescu@@ ing persons from the sea in extreme conditions .
( 3 ) Ano@@ ther way to demon@@ st@@ rate consisten@@ cy is to show that certain aspec@@ ts of the design are consistent with accepted , published standards such as the labels and abbreviations recommended in ICAO Do@@ c 8@@ 400 Procedures for Air Navigation Serv@@ ices ( pan@@ s ) - ICAO Abbreviations and Codes or in SAE AR@@ P4@@ 10@@ 5@@ C Abbreviations , Acronyms , and Terms for Use on the Flight Deck .
alternatively , applying equ@@ ation ( 5 ) ( II ) above , the Cri@@ teri@@ on would also be met if the model were seen to cap@@ size just three times ( for example ) in a total 21.5 hours of exposure to the sea condition , or four times ( for example ) in a total of 25.@@ 5 hours of exposure .
the applicant might standardi@@ se the symbols used to dep@@ ic@@ t navigation aids ( very high frequency Omnidirectional range ( VOR ) , for example ) , by following the conven@@ tions recommended in SAE AR@@ P@@ 5@@ 28@@ 9@@ A &@@ a@@ po@@ s@@ ; Electronic aer@@ on@@ autical Symbols .
UL@@ min may be compared to the strength of the P@@ CD@@ S components already substanti@@ ated according to Direc@@ tive 89 / 68@@ 6 / E@@ EC , or Regulation ( E@@ U ) 20@@ 16 / 425 , as applicable , or subsequent revision and the corresponding en Standards or Direc@@ tive 200@@ 6 / 42 / EC An@@ ne@@ x I Point 6 .
as above , the Cri@@ teri@@ on would also be met if the model were seen to cap@@ size just three times ( for example ) in a total 2.2 hours of exposure to the sea condition , or four times ( for example ) in a total of 2.6 hours of exposure .
Note 7 : direc@@ tive 200@@ 6 / 42 / EC An@@ ne@@ x I Point 6 recommen@@ ds a safety factor of 14 ( 2 × 7 ) for tex@@ ti@@ les applied to the working load ( equivalent to 14 M above ) for equipment lifting hu@@ man@@ s , whe@@ re@@ as for a rescue harness , en 14@@ 97 requires a static test load of not less than the greater of either 15 kN or 10 times the working load .
considering this difference , for each tex@@ ti@@ le component within the P@@ CD@@ S certified to one of the following EN@@ s , the value of K may be reduced , such that UL@@ min is not less than 10 mg , where M is not more than 150 kg :
as above , the Cri@@ teri@@ on would also be met if the model were seen to cap@@ size just three times ( for example ) in a total 6.5 hours of exposure to the sea condition , or four times ( for example ) in a total of 7.6 hours of exposure .
Fur@@ ther@@ more , to allow this reduced value of UL@@ min and to address any potential deterioration of tex@@ ti@@ les due to environmental and other hidden damage , the IC@@ A must include a life limitation of 5 years ( or the life indicated by the P@@ CD@@ S manufacturer , if less ) and an an@@ nu@@ al detailed inspection of the general condition of the harness .
in such cases , it should be demonstrated that the design of the interface is compatible with the requirements of the pi@@ lo@@ ting task , and that it can be used individually and in combination with other interfaces without interference with either the system or the function .
when the simple P@@ CD@@ S and the related attachment elements are limited to the carriage of HE@@ C only , no further specific fatigue substantiation is necessary for each part of the simple P@@ CD@@ S that is either :
the overall risk of cap@@ si@@ zing within the 5-minute exposure period consists of two components : the probability of cap@@ si@@ zing in a given wave condition , and the probability of experi@@ en@@ cing that wave condition in an emergency landing on water .
if it is assumed that an emergency landing on water occurs at random and is not linked with weather conditions , the overall risk of a cap@@ size can be established by comb@@ ining two pieces of information :
video records are to incorporate a time code to facilitate synchron@@ is@@ ation with the wave elevation records in order to permit the investig@@ ation of the circumstances and details of a particular cap@@ size event .
where Vibration health Monitoring is used as a compensating provi@@ sion to meet CS 29.@@ 9@@ 17 ( b ) , the design and performance of the vibration health monitoring system should be approved by requesting compliance with CS 29.@@ 14@@ 65 ( a ) .
( a ) Identification of any single failure , malfunction , or reason@@ ably conce@@ iv@@ able combinations of failures that may result in a loss of oil pressure , a loss of oil supply to the dynamic components or a loss of the oil scavenge function .
8 Com@@ mission Regulation ( E@@ U ) No 744 / 2010 of 18 Au@@ gust 2010 am@@ ending Regulation ( EC ) No 1005 / 2009 of the E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ ea@@ n Par@@ li@@ ament and of the Co@@ unci@@ l on substances that deplete the ozone layer , with reg@@ ard to the critical uses of hal@@ on ( O@@ J L 218 , 19.@@ 8.@@ 2010 , p . 2 ) .
( B ) The safety Assessment should consider any specific design features which are subject to vari@@ ability in manufacture or wear / degradation in service and which could have an app@@ rec@@ i@@ able effect on the maximum period of operation following loss of lubrication .
any features that may have a significant influence on the be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our of the residual oil or the auxiliary lubrication system should be taken into account when determining the configuration of test articles .
( C ) Identification of the most severe failure mode that results in the shortest duration of time in which the gearbox should be able to operate following the indication to the flight crew of a norm@@ al-@@ use lubrication system failure .
however , there would still remain a very large number of intermediate wave height / period combinations that would need to be investig@@ ated in model tests , and it is considered that such a test program@@ me would be too leng@@ th@@ y and co@@ st@@ ly to be prac@@ ti@@ cable .
( D ) Auxiliary lubrication system : where compliance with CS 29.@@ 9@@ 27 ( c ) is reli@@ ant upon the operation of an auxiliary lubrication system , sufficient independ@@ ence between the norm@@ al-@@ use and auxiliary lubrication systems should be substanti@@ ated .
it should be established that no single failure or identified comm@@ on-@@ cause failure will prevent the operation of both the norm@@ al-@@ use and the auxiliary lubrication systems , apart from any failures that are determined to be extremely remote lubrication failures .
the means for the flight crew to stop the cockpit voice recorder function after the completion of the flight is needed in order to pre@@ serve the recording for the purpose of investig@@ ating accidents and serious incid@@ ents .
the objective here is therefore to establish a j@@ us@@ ti@@ fiable method of e@@ sti@@ mating the overall 5@@ - minute cap@@ size probability using model test results for a single-@@ wave condition . that is a single combination of HS and T@@ z .
such a means to stop the cockpit voice recorder function is not in contra@@ dic@@ tion with FAA AC 29-@@ 2C , § AC 29.@@ 13@@ 57 , § 29.@@ 13@@ 57 , point b . ( 6 ) , because it would not be used under normal operating conditions , but only after an accid@@ ent or a serious incident has occurred .
( 1 ) Lubrication System Failure : in the con@@ text of CS 29.@@ 9@@ 17 ( b ) , references to a failure of the lubrication system should be interpreted as any failure that results in a loss of pressure and an associated low oil pressure warning , within the duration of one flight .
( 2 ) most severe failure mode : the failure mode of the normal use lubrication system that results in the shortest duration of time in which the gearbox is expected to operate following an indication to the flight crew .
failure modes which may result in the subsequent failure of both the auxiliary and the norm@@ al-@@ use lubrication systems and which may prevent continued safe flight or safe landing should be shown to be extremely remote lubrication failures .
( 6 ) Extremely remote lubrication failure : a lubrication failure where the li@@ k@@ eli@@ hood of occurrence has been minim@@ is@@ ed , either by structural analysis in accordance with CS 29.@@ 571 or laboratory testing .
failure modes including failures of external pipes , fittings , cool@@ ers , or hoses , and any components that require periodic removal by main@@ ta@@ in@@ ers , should not be considered as extremely remote lubrication failures .
the determination that a failure is an extremely remote lubrication failure , when used to eliminate a potential failure mode from being considered as a can@@ didate most severe failure mode , should be substanti@@ ated .
this should be accomplished as part of the CS 29.@@ 9@@ 17 ( b ) design Assessment , and include leaks from any connections between components that are assembled together , such as threaded connections , hydraulic inserts , gaskets , seals , and packing ( O-rings ) .
failure modes , such as failures of external lines , failures of component retention hardware and w@@ all@@ - through cracks that have not been substanti@@ ated for CS 29.@@ 307 , CS 29.@@ 571 and CS 29.@@ 9@@ 23 ( m ) should also be considered .
model tests are performed in the sea condition HS ( limit ) T@@ z ( limit ) ( where T@@ z ( limit ) is the zero-@@ crossing period most likely to ac@@ company HS ( limit ) ) with the selected spectrum shape using the method specified above , and the 5-minute probability of cap@@ si@@ zing ( P@@ cap@@ size ) established in this sea condition .
therefore , designs should be conce@@ ived such that sh@@ ared components or interfaces between the norm@@ al-@@ use and auxiliary lubrication systems are minim@@ is@@ ed and comply with the design Assessment provisions of CS 29.@@ 9@@ 17 ( b ) .
in j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions where flying over waves greater than HS ( limit ) is permitted , the Ro@@ tor@@ craft will have passed the certification criteria provided that P@@ cap@@ size ≤ P@@ cap@@ size ( target ) - P@@ e , where P@@ e is the probability of exceedance of HS ( limit ) .
a failure of any common feature sh@@ ared by both the norm@@ al-@@ use and auxiliary lubrication systems that could result in the failure of both systems , and would con@@ sequ@@ ently reduce the maximum period of operation following loss of lubrication , should be shown to be an extremely remote lubrication failure .
( 1 ) in the un@@ likely event of a combined failure of both the norm@@ al-@@ use lubrication system and the auxiliary lubrication system , the RFM emergency procedures should instruct the flight crew to L@@ and immediately unless testing representing this failure mode has been performed in order to substanti@@ ate that an increased duration is j@@ us@@ tified ;
in cases where the recorder performs several recording functions , the means for pre-@@ flight checking of the recorder for proper operation should indicate which recording functions ( e.g. FDR , CVR , data link recording , etc . ) have failed .
( 2 ) a means of verifying that the auxiliary lubrication system is functioning properly should be provided during normal operation of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft on either a periodic , pre-@@ flight or contin@@ ual basis .
the following acceptable means of compliance with CS 29.@@ 14@@ 57 ( b ) is provided to demon@@ st@@ rate that the performance of a new or modified CVR system is acceptable and that the quality of the CVR recording is acceptable .
( 1 ) Ditching : a controlled emergency landing on water , deli@@ b@@ era@@ tely executed in accordance with Ro@@ tor@@ craft flight manual ( RFM ) procedures , with the intent of ab@@ and@@ on@@ ing the Ro@@ tor@@ craft as soon as prac@@ ti@@ cable .
( II ) common failure modes shown to de@@ fe@@ at both the norm@@ al-@@ use and the auxiliary lubrication systems should be shown to be extremely remote lubrication failures , unless it is demonstrated by testing conducted to comply with 29.@@ 9@@ 27 ( c ) that the failure mode does not comp@@ ro@@ mi@@ se the Maximum period of operation following loss of lubrication ;
Note : although the term ditching is most commonly associated with the design standards related to CS 29.@@ 801 , a Ro@@ tor@@ craft equipped to the less de@@ man@@ ding requirements of CS 29.@@ 802 , when performing an emergency landing on water , would ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less be commonly described as carrying out the process of ditching .
the recording obtained should be evaluated to confirm an acceptable level of quality during all normal phases of flight ( including taxi@@ -out , ho@@ ver , take-off , climb , cruise , descent , approach , landing , taxi@@ -in ) and auto@@ rotation .
operational rules may accept that a h@@ el@@ ic@@ op@@ ter conducts flights over certain sea areas provided it is fitted with approved emergency flo@@ tation equipment ( i.e. an EF@@ S ) , rather than being certified with full ditching provisions .
checking that the levels of side tone signals ( e.g. radio ) and public address ( PA ) are adjusted so that these signals are audible and do not mask the signals from the flight crew microphones ( refer to ED@@ -@@ 1@@ 12A , Part I , Chapter I-@@ 6.@@ 1.1 ) ;
( VI ) Assessment of the potential d@@ or@@ m@@ ant failure modes of the auxiliary lubrication system , and in order to minim@@ i@@ se the risk of d@@ or@@ m@@ ant failures , determination of the health of the auxiliary lubrication system prior to each flight .
( 4 ) The sea conditions on which certification with emergency flo@@ tation is to be based are selected by the applicant and should take into account the expected sea conditions in the intended areas of operation .
( 2 ) CS 29.@@ 9@@ 27 ( c ) is intended to apply to press@@ ur@@ is@@ ed lubrication systems , as the li@@ k@@ eli@@ hood of loss of lubrication is significantly greater for gearboxes that use press@@ ur@@ is@@ ed lubrication and external cooling .
this is due to the increased comple@@ xity of the lubrication system , the external components that circulate oil outside the gearbox , and the resultant rapid lea@@ k@@ ages that may occur with a press@@ ur@@ is@@ ed system .
previous model tests and other data from Ro@@ tor@@ craft of similar configurations that have already been substanti@@ ated based on equivalent test conditions may be used to satisfy the emergency flo@@ tation requirements .
accordingly , this provi@@ sion is not applicable to gearboxes that are not essential for continued safe flight or safe landing and which have a lubrication system which is independent of other essential gearboxes .
( 6 ) CS 29.@@ 802 requires that in sea conditions for which certification with emergency flo@@ tation is requested by the applicant , the probability of cap@@ si@@ zing in a 5-minute exposure is accep@@ ta@@ bly low in order to allow the occupants to leave the Ro@@ tor@@ craft and enter the life rafts .
this should be interpreted to mean that up to and including the wor@@ st-@@ case sea conditions for which certification with emergency flo@@ tation is requested by the applicant , the probability that the Ro@@ tor@@ craft will cap@@ size should be not higher than the target sta@@ ted in CS 29.@@ 802 ( c ) .
this should be interpreted to mean that up to and including the wor@@ st@@ - case sea conditions for which certification with ditching provisions is requested by the applicant , the probability that the Ro@@ tor@@ craft will cap@@ size should be not higher than the target sta@@ ted in the certification specification .
( 7 ) Providing a wet floor concept ( water in the cabin ) by positioning the flo@@ ats higher on the fuselage sides and allowing the Ro@@ tor@@ craft to float lower in the water can be a way of increasing the stability of a dit@@ ched Ro@@ tor@@ craft ( although this would need to be verified for the individual Ro@@ tor@@ craft type for all weight and loading conditions ) , or it may be desirable for other reasons .
( 5 ) The intent of the rule change for Category A Ro@@ tor@@ craft is to provide confidence in the continued flight capability of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft , which should be of at least 30 minutes duration after the loss of lubricant pressure in any single Ro@@ tor@@ craft drive system gearbox , with the aim of op@@ ti@@ mi@@ sing the even@@ tual landing opportun@@ ities .
the replay and evaluation of CVR recor@@ dings should be performed by personnel with adequate knowledge of CVR systems and aircraft operations , and who have the appropriate experience with the techniques used to evaluate recor@@ dings ;
in order to enable the crew to determine the saf@@ est action in the event of a loss of gearbox oil , the emergency procedures of the Ro@@ tor@@ craft flight manual ( RFM ) should include instructions that define the maximum time period within which the Ro@@ tor@@ craft should land .
experience has shown that in water-@@ impact events , the forces exerted on the emergency flo@@ tation unit that first comes into contact with the water surface , together with structural deformation and other damage , can ren@@ der the unit unusable .
this AM@@ C provides guidance for the completion of the loss of lubrication test and for how to demon@@ st@@ rate confidence in the margin of safety associated with the maximum period of operation following loss of lubrication , and associated period defined in the RFM emergency procedures .
the failure of the lubrication system should not imp@@ air the ability of the crew to continue the safe operation of Category A Ro@@ tor@@ craft for the defined period after an indication of the failure has been provided to the flight crew .
when considering a v@@ oc@@ al signal source ( crew voice , radio reception , radio side tone , interphone , public address , synthetic voice in cal@@ l-@@ ou@@ ts , warnings and alerts ) recorded on a channel other than the CAM channel , the signal is in@@ tel@@ l@@ ig@@ ible without using any signal post-@@ processing techniques , and no significant issue ( e.g. saturation , noise , interference , or inadequate signal level of a source ) affects the quality of this signal ;
for a Ro@@ tor@@ craft with a seating capacity of maximum 9 passengers , CS 29.@@ 802 ( a ) only requires the flo@@ ats and their attachments to the Ro@@ tor@@ craft to be designed to withstand the load conditions defined in CS 29.@@ 56@@ 3 .
when considering non-@@ v@@ oc@@ al alerts recorded on a channel other than the CAM channel , the sounds are accurately identifiable in the recording without using any signal post-@@ processing techniques , and no significant issue affects the quality of the sound recording ;
( 1 ) CS 29.@@ 9@@ 27 ( c ) pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ es a test that is intended to demon@@ st@@ rate that no hazardous failure or malfunction will occur within a defined period , and in a specified re@@ du@@ ce@@ d-@@ power condition , in the event of a significant failure of the rotor drive lubrication system .
when considering the CAM , the recording is represen@@ tative of the actual ambient sound , conversations and alerts as if an observer were li@@ ste@@ ning in the cockpit , and no significant issue affects the quality of the signal ;
( 2 ) since this is a test of the capability of the gearbox to operate with residual oil or oil supplied from an auxiliary lubrication system , the method for draining the oil and the operating conditions are also defined in the provi@@ sion .
all parts of Ro@@ tor@@ craft with a seating capacity of 10 passengers of more should be designed to withstand the load conditions defined in CS 29.@@ 56@@ 3 ( i.e. the same design standards as for full ditching approval ) .
however , the related signal can still be analy@@ sed without signal post-@@ processing , or by using signal post-@@ processing techniques provided by standard audio analysis tools ( e.g. audio level adjustment , notch filter , etc . ) .
